Multiple hook functions can be chained to create complex work-flows. A hook is **transport independent**, which means it does not matter if it has been called internally on the server, through HTTP(S) (REST), websockets or any other transport Feathers supports. They are also service agnostic, meaning they can be used with ​**any**​ service regardless of whether they use a database or not.\n\nHooks are commonly used to handle things like permissions, validation, logging, [authentication](./authentication/hook.md), [data schemas and resolvers](./schema/index.md), sending notifications and more. This pattern keeps your application logic flexible, composable, and easier to trace through and debug. For more information about the design patterns behind hooks see [this blog post](https://blog.feathersjs.com/api-service-composition-with-hooks-47af13aa6c01).\n\n## Quick Example\n\nThe following example logs the runtime of any service method on the `messages` service and adds `createdAt` property before saving the data to the database:\n\n```ts\nimport { feathers, type HookContext, type NextFunction } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\nconst app = feathers()\n\napp.service('messages').hooks({\n  around: {\n    all: [\n      // A hook that wraps around all other hooks and the service method\n      // logging the total runtime of a successful call\n      async (context: HookContext, next: NextFunction) => {\n        const startTime = Date.now()\n\n        await next()\n\n        console.log(`Method ${context.method} on ${context.path} took ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`)\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  before: {\n    create: [\n      async (context: HookContext) => {\n        context.data = {\n          ...context.data,\n          createdAt: Date.now()\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n})\n```\n\n<BlockQuote type=\"info\">\n\nWhile it is always possible to add properties like `createdAt` in the above example via hooks, the preferred way to make data modifications like this in Feathers 5 is via [schemas and resolvers](./schema/index.md).\n\n</BlockQuote>\n\n## Hook functions\n\n### before, after and error\n\n`before`, `after` and `error` hook functions are functions that are `async` or return a promise and take the [hook context](#hook-context) as the parameter and return nothing or throw an error.\n\n```ts\nimport { HookContext } from '../declarations'\n\nexport const hookFunction = async (context: HookContext) => {\n  // Do things here\n}\n```\n\nFor more information see the [hook flow](#hook-flow) section.\n\n### around\n\n`around` hooks are a special kind of hook that allow to control the entire `before`, `after` and `error` flow in a single function. They are a Feathers specific version of the generic [@feathersjs/hooks](https://github.com/feathersjs/hooks). An `around` hook is an `async` function that accepts two arguments:\n\n- The [hook context](#h",

It works in Node, React Native and the browser (see the [client](./client.md) chapter for more information). Each instance allows for registration and retrieval of [services](./services.md), [hooks](./hooks.md), plugin configuration, and getting and setting configuration options. An initialized Feathers application is referred to as the **app object**.\n\n```ts\nimport { feathers } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\ntype ServiceTypes = {\n  // Add registered services here\n}\n\n// Types for `app.set(name, value)` and `app.get(name)`\ntype Configuration = {\n  port: number\n}\n\nconst app = feathers<ServiceTypes, Configuration>()\n```\n\n## .use(path, service [, options])\n\n`app.use(path, service [, options]) -> app` allows registering a [service object](./services.md) on a given `path`.\n\n```ts\nimport { feathers, type Id } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\nclass MessageService {\n  async get(id: Id) {\n    return {\n      id,\n      text: `This is the ${id} message!`\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ntype ServiceTypes = {\n  // Add services path to type mapping here\n  messages: MessageService\n}\n\nconst app = feathers<ServiceTypes>()\n\n// Register a service instance on the app\napp.use('messages', new MessageService())\n\n// Get the service and call the service method with the correct types\nconst message = await app.service('messages').get('test')\n```\n\n### path\n\nThe `path` is a string that should be URL friendly and may contain `/` as a separator. `path` can also be `/` to register a service at the root level. A path may contain placeholders in the form of `:userId/messages` which will be included in `params.route` by a transport.\n\n### options\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n- `methods` (default: `['find', 'get', 'create', 'patch', 'update','remove']`) - A list of official and [custom service methods](services.md#custom-methods) that should be available to clients. When using this option **all** method names that should be available externally must be passed. Those methods will automatically be available for use with [hooks](./hooks).\n- `events` - A list of [public custom events sent by this service](./events.md#custom-events)\n\n```ts\nimport { EventEmitter } from 'events'\nimport { feathers, type Id } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\n// Feathers services will always be event emitters\n// but we can also extend it for better type consistency\nclass MessageService extends EventEmitter {\n  async doSomething(data: { message: string }, params: Params) {\n    this.emit('something',",

    "content": "---\noutline: deep\n---\n\n# Channels\n\nOn a Feathers server with a real-time transport (like [Socket.io](./socketio.md)) configured, event channels determine which connected clients to send [real-time events](./events.md) to and how the sent data should look.\n\nThis chapter describes:\n\n- [Concepts](#concepts) of real-time communication\n- [An example](#example) channels.js file\n- [Real-time Connections](#connections) and how to access them\n- [Channel usage](#channels) and how to retrieve, join and leave channels\n- [Publishing events](#publishing) to channels\n\n<BlockQuote label=\"Important\">\n\nChannels functionality will not be available in the following two scenarios:\n\n- When you're making a rest-only API, not using a real-time adapter.\n- When you're using Feathers on the client. Only server-side Feathers has channel management.\n\n</BlockQuote>\n\nHere are some example logic conditions where channels are useful:\n\n- Real-time events should only be sent to authenticated users\n- Users should only get updates about messages from chat rooms they joined\n- Only users in the same organization should receive real-time updates about their data changes\n- Only admins should be notified when new users are created\n- When a user is created, modified or removed, non-admins should only receive a \"safe\" version of the user object (e.g. only `email`, `id` and `avatar`)\n\n## Concepts\n\nA **_channel_** is basically an array of **_connection_** objects. Each array is explicitly given a name. When using a real-time server transport and a new client connects, you can tell the server to explicitly add that client's connection object to any relevant channels. Any connection in a channel will receive all events that are sent to that channel. This allows clients to receive only their intended messages.\n\nWhen using a real-time transport, the server pushes events (such as \"created\", \"removed\" etc. for a particular service) down to its clients. Using channels allows customizing which clients should receive each event. The client doesn’t subscribe to individual channels, directly, but rather subscribes to specific events like `created`, `patched`, custom events, etc, in which they are interested. Those events will only fire for a client if the server pushes data to one a channel to which the client has been added.\n\nYou can have any number of channels. This helps to organise how data is sent and to control the volume of data, by not sending things that aren't relevant.\n\nThe server can also change connection channel membership from time to time, eg. before vs after login.\n\nThe server needs to explicitly **publish** channels it is interested in sharing with clients before they become available.\n\n## Example\n\nThe example below shows a `channels.js` file illustrating how the different parts fit together:\n\n```ts\nimport type { RealTimeConnection, Params } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\nimport type { Application, HookContext } from './declarations'\n\nexport default function (app: any) {\n  if (typeof app",

In contrast with most other frameworks, it isn't a separate library; instead you get the exact same functionality with a client and on a server. This means you can use [services](./services.md) and [hooks](./hooks.md) and configure plugins. By default, a Feathers client automatically creates services that talk to a Feathers server.\n\nIn order to connect to a Feathers server, a client creates [Services](./services.md) that use a REST or websocket connection to relay method calls and - for a real-time transport like Socket.io - allow listening to [events](./events.md) on the server. This means the [Feathers application instance](./application.md) is usable the exact same way as on the server.\n\nModules most relevant on the client are:\n\n- `@feathersjs/feathers` to initialize a new Feathers [application](./application.md)\n- [@feathersjs/rest-client](./client/rest.md) to connect to services through REST HTTP provided by [Koa](./koa.md) or [Express](./express.md).\n- [@feathersjs/socketio-client](./client/socketio.md) to connect to services through [Socket.io](./socketio.md).\n- [@feathersjs/authentication-client](./authentication/client.md) to authenticate a client\n\n<BlockQuote type=\"warning\" label=\"Important\">\n\nYou do not have to use Feathers on the client to connect to a Feathers server. The client [REST client](./client/rest.md) and [Socket.io client](./client/socketio.md) chapters also describe how to use the connection directly without Feathers on the client side.\n\n</BlockQuote>\n\nThis chapter describes how to set up Feathers as the client in Node, React Native and in the browser with a module loader like Webpack or Parcel or through a `<script>` tag. The examples are using [the Socket.io client](./client/socketio.md). For other connection methods see the chapters linked above.\n\n## Typed client\n\nA Feathers application generated with Feathers v5 or later now exports a client file, including the types you defined in [schemas](./schema/index.md) on the server. For more information see the [CLI guide](../guides/cli/client.md)\n\n## Node\n\nTo connect to a Feathers server in NodeJS, install the desired client connection library (here, `socket.io-client`), alongside the Feathers core library, and the connection-specific library:\n\n```\nnpm install @feathersjs/feathers @feathersjs/socketio-client socket.io-client --save\n```\n\nThen initialize like this:\n\n```ts\nimport io from 'socket.io-client'\nimport { feathers } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\nimport socketio from '@feathersjs/socketio-client'\n\nconst socket = io('http://api.my-feathers-server.com')\nconst client = feathers()\n\nclient.configure(socketio(socket))\n\nconst messageService = client.service('messages')\n\nmessageService.on('created', (message: Message) => console.log('Created a message', message))\n\n// Use the messages service from the server\nmessageService.create({\n  text: 'Message from",

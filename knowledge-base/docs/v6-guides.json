    "content": "# Creating an app\n\nIn the [quick start](./starting) we created a Feathers application in a single file to get a better understanding of how Feathers itself works.\n\n \n\nThe [Feathers CLI](../cli/index) allows us to initialize a new Feathers server with a recommended structure and generate things we commonly need like authentication, a database connection or new services. In this guide we will create a Feathers HTTP and real-time API for a chat application using the Feathers CLI. Using it, for example with [a JavaScript frontend](../frontend/javascript), looks like this:\n\n![The Feathers chat application](../basics/assets/feathers-chat.png)\n\nYou can find the complete example in the [feathers-chat repository](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat).\n\n## Generating the application\n\nYou can create a new Feathers application by running `npm create feathers  `. To create a new Feathers application called `feathers-chat` we can run:\n\n```sh\nnpm create feathers@latest feathers-chat\n```\n\nIf you never ran the command before you might be asked to confirm the package installation by pressing enter. The `@latest` in the command makes sure that the most recent released version of the CLI is used.\n\nFirst, choose if you want to use JavaScript or TypeScript. When presented with the project name, just hit enter, or enter a name (no spaces). Next, write a short description for your application. Confirm the next questions with the default selection by pressing Enter. If you choose a database other than __SQLite__, make sure it is reachable at the connection string. For following this guide using MongoDB, change the database selection in the dropdown below.\n\n \n\nOnce you confirm the last prompt, the final selection should look similar to this:\n\n![feathers generate app prompts](./assets/generate-app.png)\n\nSweet! We generated our first Feathers application in a new folder called `feathers-chat` so we need to go there.\n\n```sh\ncd feathers-chat\n```\n\n## Running the server and tests\n\nThe server can be started by running\n\n```sh\nnpm run compile\nnpm run migrate\nnpm start\n```\n\nAfter that, you will see the Feathers logo at\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3030\n```\n\nThe app also comes with a set of basic tests which can be run with\n\n```sh\nnpm test\n```\n\nThere is also a handy development command that restarts the server automatically whenever we make a code change:\n\n```sh\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n## What's next?\n\nIn this chapter, we've created a new Feathers application. To learn more about the generated files and what you can do with the CLI, have a look at the [CLI guide](../cli/index) after finishing the Getting Started guide. In [the next chapter](./authentication) we will set up user authentication.",

In the [authentication chapter](./authentication) we generated everything necessary for using Feathers authentication so let's look at how to register users and add a log in with GitHub to our chat.\n\n## Registering a user\n\nThe HTTP REST API can be used directly to register a new user. We can do this by sending a POST request to `http://localhost:3030/users` with JSON data like this as the body:\n\n```js\n// POST /users\n{\n  \"email\": \"hello@feathersjs.com\",\n  \"password\": \"supersecret\"\n}\n```\n\nTry it:\n\n```sh\ncurl 'http://localhost:3030/users/' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --data-binary '{ \"email\": \"hello@feathersjs.com\", \"password\": \"supersecret\" }'\n```\n\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/6bcea48aac6c7494c2ad)\n\nThis will return something like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": 123,\n  \"email\": \"hello@feathersjs.com\",\n  \"avatar\": \"https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/ffe2a09df37d7c646e974a2d2b8d3e03?s=60\"\n}\n```\n\nWhich means our user has been created successfully.\n\n## Logging in\n\nBy default, Feathers uses [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) for authentication. It is an access token that is issued by the Feathers server for a limited time (one day by default) and needs to be sent with every API request that requires authentication. Usually a token is issued for a specific user. Let's see if we can issue a JWT for the user that we just created.\n\nTokens can be created by sending a POST request to the `/authentication` endpoint (which is the same as calling the `create` method on the `authentication` service set up in `src/authentication`) and passing the authentication strategy you want to use along with any other relevant data. To get a JWT for an existing user through a username (email) and password login, we can use the built-in `local` authentication strategy with a request like this:\n\n```js\n// POST /authentication\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"local\",\n  \"email\": \"hello@feathersjs.com\",\n  \"password\": \"supersecret\"\n}\n```\n\nTry it:\n\n```sh\ncurl 'http://localhost:3030/authentication/' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --data-binary '{ \"strategy\": \"local\", \"email\": \"hello@feathersjs.com\", \"password\": \"supersecret\" }'\n```\n\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/6bcea48aac6c7494c2ad)\n\nThis will return something like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"accessToken\": \" \",\n  \"authentication\": {\n    \"strategy\": \"local\"\n  },\n  \"user\": {\n    \"id\": 123,\n    \"email\": \"hello@feathersjs.com\",\n    \"avatar\": \"https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/ffe2a09df37d7c646e974a2d2b8d3e03?s=60\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `accessToken` can now be used for other REST requests that require authentication by sending the `Authorization: Bearer  ` HTTP header. For example to create a new message:\n\n```sh\ncurl 'http://localhost:3030/messages/' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer  ' \\\n  --data-binary '{ \"text\": \"Hello from the console\" }'\n```\n\nThat's pretty neat, but emails and passwords are boring, let's spice things up a bit.\n\n## Login with GitHub\n\nOAuth is an open authentication standard supported by almost every major social platform and what gets us the log in with Facebook, Google, GitHub etc. buttons. From the Feathers perspective, the authentication flow with OAuth is pretty similar. Instead of authenticating with the `local` strategy by sending a username and password, Feathers directs the user to authorize the application with the login provider. If it is successful, Feathers authentication finds or creates the user in the `users` service with the information it got back from the provider and then issues a token for them.\n\nTo allow login with GitHub, we first have to [create a new OAuth application on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). You can put anything in the name, homepage and description fields. The callback U\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

    "content": "# Schemas and resolvers\n\nIn Feathers, schemas and resolvers allow us to define, validate and secure our data model and types.\n\n \n\nAs we've briefly seen in the [previous chapter about hooks](./hooks), there were a few hooks registered already to validate schemas and resolve data. Schema validators and resolvers are used with those hooks to modify data in the hook context. Similar to how Feathers services are transport independent, schemas and resolvers are database independent. It comes in two main parts:\n\n- [TypeBox](../../api/schema/typebox) or [JSON schema](../../api/schema/schema) to define a schema. This allows us to do things like:\n  - Ensure data is valid and always in the right format\n  - Automatically get up to date TypeScript types from schema definitions\n  - Create a typed client that can be used in React, Vue etc. apps\n  - Automatically generate API documentation\n  - Validate query string filters and convert them to the correct types\n- [Resolvers](../../api/schema/resolvers) - Resolve schema properties based on a context (usually the [hook context](./hooks)). This can be used for many different things like:\n  - Populating associations\n  - Securing queries and limiting the type of requests the logged in user can perform\n  - Safely hiding sensitive data for external clients\n  - Adding read and write permissions on the property field level\n  - Hashing passwords and validating dynamic password policies\n\nIn this chapter we will look at the generated schemas and resolvers and update them with the information we need for our chat application.\n\n## Feathers schemas\n\nWhile schemas and resolvers can be used outside of a Feathers application, you will usually encounter them in a Feathers context where they come in four kinds:\n\n- **Result** schemas and resolvers that define the data that is being returned. This is also where associated data would be fetched\n- **Data** schemas and resolvers handle the data from a `create`, `update`, `patch`, or custom service method and can be used to add/replace things like default or calculated values (e.g. the `createdAt` or `updatedAt` date) before saving it to the database\n- **Query** schemas and resolvers validate and convert the query string and can also be used for additional limitations like only allowing a user to see and modify their own data\n- **External** resolvers return a safe version of the data (by e.g. hiding a users password) that can be sent to external clients\n\nWhile it may initially look like a bit more code, schema driven development is a great way to have the data models and how data is modified in a single place.\n\n## Adding a user avatar\n\nLet's extend our existing users schema to add an `avatar` property so that our users can have a profile image.\n\nFirst we need to update the `src/services/users/users.schema.ts` file with the schema property for the avatar and a resolver property that sets a default avatar using the [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) based on the email address:\n\n```ts{2,17-18,34,44-54,68,82-86}\n// For more information about this file see https://dove.feathersjs.com/guides/cli/service.schemas.html\nimport crypto from 'crypto'\nimport { resolve } from '@feathersjs/schema'\nimport { Type, getValidator, querySyntax } from '@feathersjs/typebox'\nimport type { Static } from '@feathersjs/typebox'\nimport { passwordHash } from '@feathersjs/authentication-local'\n\nimport type { HookContext } from '../../declarations'\nimport { dataValidator, queryValidator } from '../../validators'\n\n// Main data model schema\nexport const userSchema = Type.Object(\n  {\n    id: Type.Number(),\n    email: Type.String(),\n    password: Type.Optional(Type.String()),\n    githubId: Type.Optional(Type.Number()),\n    avatar: Type.Optional(Type.String())\n  },\n  { $id: 'User', additionalProperties: false }\n)\nexport type User = Static \nexport const userValidator = getValidator(userSchema, dataValidator)\nexport const userResolver = resolve ({})\n\nexport const userExternalResolver = resolve ({\n  // The \n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

    "content": "# Quick start\n\nAlright then! Let's learn Feathers. In this quick start guide we'll create our first Feathers app, an API server and a simple website to use it. You'll see how easy it is to get started with Feathers in just a single file without additional boilerplate or tooling. If you want to jump right into creating a complete application you can go to the [Creating An App](./generator) chapter.\n\n \n\nFeathers works with all [currently active NodeJS releases](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule). All guides are assuming the languages features from the most current stable NodeJS release which you can get from the [NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/).\n\nAfter successful installation, the `node` and `npm` commands should be available on the terminal:\n\n```\nnode --version\n```\n\n```\nnpm --version\n```\n\nLet's create a new folder for our application:\n\n```sh\nmkdir feathers-basics\ncd feathers-basics\n```\n\nSince any Feathers application is a Node application, we can create a default [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) using `npm`:\n\n```sh\nnpm init --yes\n# Install TypeScript and its NodeJS wrapper\nnpm i typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev\n# Also initialize a TS configuration file that uses modern JavaScript\nnpx tsc --init --target es2020\n```\n\n## Installing Feathers\n\nFeathers can be installed like any other Node module by installing the [@feathersjs/feathers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@feathersjs/feathers) package through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). The same package can also be used with module loaders like Vite, Webpack, and in React Native.\n\n```sh\nnpm install @feathersjs/feathers --save\n```\n\n## Our first app\n\nNow we can create a Feathers application with a simple `messages` service that allows us to create new messages and find all existing ones.\n\nCreate a file called `app.ts` with the following content:\n\n```ts\nimport { feathers } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\n// This is the interface for the message data\ninterface Message {\n  id?: number\n  text: string\n}\n\n// A messages service that allows us to create new\n// and return all existing messages\nclass MessageService {\n  messages: Message[] = []\n\n  async find() {\n    // Just return all our messages\n    return this.messages\n  }\n\n  async create(data: Pick ) {\n    // The new message is the data text with a unique identifier added\n    // using the messages length since it changes whenever we add one\n    const message: Message = {\n      id: this.messages.length,\n      text: data.text\n    }\n\n    // Add new message to the list\n    this.messages.push(message)\n\n    return message\n  }\n}\n\n// This tells TypeScript what services we are registering\ntype ServiceTypes = {\n  messages: MessageService\n}\n\nconst app = feathers ()\n\n// Register the message service on the Feathers application\napp.use('messages', new MessageService())\n\n// Log every time a new message has been created\napp.service('messages').on('created', (message: Message) => {\n  console.log('A new message has been created', message)\n})\n\n// A function that creates messages and then logs\n// all existing messages on the service\nconst main = async () => {\n  // Create a new message on our message service\n  await app.service('messages').create({\n    text: 'Hello Feathers'\n  })\n\n  // And another one\n  await app.service('messages').create({\n    text: 'Hello again'\n  })\n\n  // Find all existing messages\n  const messages = await app.service('messages').find()\n\n  console.log('All messages', messages)\n}\n\nmain()\n```\n\nWe can run it with\n\n```sh\nnpx ts-node app.ts\n```\n\n[Try it out live >](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-mupbmh?embed=1&file=app.ts&view=editor)\n\nWe will see something like this in the terminal:\n\n```sh\nA new message has been created { id: 0, text: 'Hello Feathers' }\nA new message has been created { id: 1, text: 'Hello again' }\nAll messages [ { id: 0, text: 'Hello Feathers' },\n  { id: 1, text: 'Hello again' } ]\n```\n\nHere we implemented only `find` and `create`, but a service can also have a few other method\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

    "content": "# Writing tests\n\nThe best way to test an application is by writing tests that make sure it behaves to clients as we would expect. Feathers makes testing your application a lot easier because the services we create can be tested directly instead of having to fake HTTP requests and responses. In this chapter we will implement unit tests for our users and messages services.\n\nYou can run code linting and Mocha tests with:\n\n```sh\nnpm test\n```\n\nThis should already pass but it won't be testing any of the functionality we added in the guide so far.\n\n## Test database setup\n\nWhen testing database functionality, we want to make sure that the tests use a different database. We can achieve this by updating the test environment configuration in `config/test.json` with the following content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nedb\": \"../test/data\"\n}\n```\n\nThis will set up the NeDB database to use `test/data` as the base directory instead of `data/` when the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `test`. The same thing can be done with connection strings for other databases.\n\nWe also want to make sure that the database is cleaned up before every test run. To make that possible across platforms, first run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install shx --save-dev\n```\n\nNow we can update the `scripts` section of our `package.json` to the following:\n\n```json\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"npm run compile && npm run mocha\",\n    \"dev\": \"ts-node-dev --no-notify src/\",\n    \"start\": \"npm run compile && node lib/\",\n    \"clean\": \"shx rm -rf test/data/\",\n    \"mocha\": \"npm run clean && NODE_ENV=test ts-mocha \\\"test/**/*.ts\\\" --recursive --exit\",\n    \"compile\": \"shx rm -rf lib/ && tsc\"\n  },\n```\n\nOn Windows the `mocha` command should look like this:\n\n```sh\nnpm run clean & SET NODE_ENV=test& mocha test/ --recursive --exit\n```\n\nThis will make sure that the `test/data` folder is removed before every test run and `NODE_ENV` is set properly.\n\n## Testing services\n\nTo test the `messages` and `users` services (with all hooks wired up), we could use any REST API testing tool to make requests and verify that they return correct responses.\n\nThere is a much faster, easier and complete approach. Since everything on top of our own hooks and services is already provided (and tested) by Feathers, we can require the [application](../../api/application) object and use the [service methods](../../api/services) directly. We \"fake\" authentication by setting `params.user` manually.\n\nBy default, the generator creates a service test file that only tests that the service exists.\n\nE.g. like this in `test/services/users.test.ts`:\n\n```ts\nimport assert from 'assert';\nimport app from '../../src/app';\n\ndescribe('\\'users\\' service', () => {\n  it('registered the service', () => {\n    const service = app.service('users');\n\n    assert.ok(service, 'Registered the service');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nWe can then add similar tests that use the service. In this case we are:\n1. verifying that users can be created, the default profile image gets set and the password is encrypted\n2. ensuring that the password does not get sent to external requests\n\nReplace `test/services/users.test.ts` with the following:\n\n```ts\nimport assert from 'assert';\nimport app from '../../src/app';\n\ndescribe('\\'users\\' service', () => {\n  it('registered the service', () => {\n    const service = app.service('users');\n\n    assert.ok(service, 'Registered the service');\n  });\n\n  it('creates a user, encrypts password and adds gravatar', async () => {\n    const user = await app.service('users').create({\n      email: 'test@example.com',\n      password: 'secret'\n    });\n\n    // Verify Gravatar has been set as we'd expect\n    assert.equal(user.avatar, 'https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/55502f40dc8b7c769880b10874abc9d0?s=60');\n    // Makes sure the password got encrypted\n    assert.ok(user.password !== 'secret');\n  });\n\n  it('removes password for external requests', async () => {\n    // Setting `provider` indicates an external request\n    const params = { provider: 'rest' };\n\n    const user = \n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

You can use it with Vue, React, React Native, Angular, or whatever other front-end tech stack you choose.\n\n## Client Side Docs\n\nIf you want to learn how to use Feathers as a client in Node.js, React Native, or in the browser with a module loader like Webpack refer to the [client API docs](../api/client).\n\n## The Feathers chat\n\nThe [Feathers Chat application](../guides/) from guide gives a basic intro to using the Feathers Client in a vanilla JavaScript environment. That's a good place to start to see how things fit together. Framework specific repositories can be found at:\n\n- JavaScript + plain JS frontend: [feathersjs/feathers-chat](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat)\n- TypeScript + plain JS frontend: [feathersjs/feathers-chat-ts](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat-ts)\n- React: [feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-chat-react](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-chat-react)\n- React Native: [feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-react-native-chat](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-react-native-chat)\n- Angular: [feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-chat-angular](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-chat-angular)\n- VueJS with Vuex: [feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-chat-vuex](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-chat-vuex)\n\n## Examples\n\nBeyond the basics, see [this list](https://github.com/feathersjs/awesome-feathersjs#examples) of Feathers examples in [awesome-feathersjs](https://github.com/feathersjs/awesome-feathersjs).\n\n## Framework Integrations\n\nSee [this list](https://github.com/feathersjs/awesome-feathersjs#frontend-frameworks) of Feathers front-end framework integrations if you are looking for something that makes Feathers even easier to use with things like React, Vue or others.",

It is mobile friendly and will work in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. We won't be be using a transpiler like Webpack or Babel which is also why there is no TypeScript option. The final version can be found in `public/` folder of the [feathers-chat repository](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat/tree/dove/public).\n\n![The Feathers chat application](../basics/assets/feathers-chat.png)\n\n## Set up the page\n\nFirst, let's update `public/index.html` to initialize everything we need for the chat frontend:\n\n```html\n \n \n   \n     feathers-chat \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n   \n   \n      \n      \n      \n      \n   \n \n```\n\nThis will load our chat CSS style, add a container div `#app` and load several libraries:\n\n- The browser version of Feathers (since we are not using a module loader like Webpack or Browserify)\n- Socket.io provided by the chat API\n- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for a collection of CSS components\n- A `client.js` for our code to live in\n\nLet’s create `public/client.js` where all the following code will live. Each of the following code samples should be added to the end of that file.\n\n## Connect to the API\n\nWe’ll start with the most important thing first, the connection to our Feathers API that connects to our server using websockets and initializes the [authentication client](../basics/authentication):\n\n```js\n/* global io, feathers, moment */\n// Establish a Socket.io connection\nconst socket = io()\n// Initialize our Feathers client application through Socket.io\n// with hooks and authentication.\nconst client = feathers()\n\nclient.configure(feathers.socketio(socket))\n// Use localStorage to store our login token\nclient.configure(feathers.authentication())\n```\n\n## Base HTML\n\nNext, we have to define some static and dynamic HTML that we can insert into the page when we want to show the login page (which also doubles as the signup page) and the actual chat interface:\n\n```js\n// Login screen\nconst loginTemplate = (error) => ` \n \n     \n     \n      Feathers Chat\n     \n   \n   \n    ${\n      error\n        ? ` \n        \n       ${error.message} \n     `\n        : ''\n    }\n     \n        Email  \n       \n     \n     \n        Password  \n       \n     \n      Login  \n      Signup  \n      Login with GitHub  \n   \n \n `\n\n// Main chat view\nconst chatTemplate =\n  () => `  \n   \n     \n       \n         \n            \n         \n       \n       \n         Feathers Chat \n         \n           0  User(s)\n         \n       \n       \n         \n            \n       \n       \n     \n      \n     \n       \n         \n         Send \n       \n     \n   \n     \n     \n        Users  \n     \n   \n `\n\n// Helper to safely escape HTML\nconst escapeHTML = (str) => str.replace(/&/g, '&amp').replace(/ /g, '&gt')\n\nconst formatDate = (timestamp) =>\n  new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {\n    timeStyle: 'short',\n    dateStyle: 'medium'\n  }).format(new Date(timestamp))\n\n// Add a new user to the list\nconst addUser = (user) => {\n  const userList = document.querySelector('.user-list')\n\n  if (userList) {\n    // Add the user to the list\n    userList.innerHTML += ` \n       \n         \n             \n          ${user.email} \n       \n     `\n\n    // Update the number of users\n    const userCount = document.querySelectorAll('.user-list li.user').length\n\n    document.querySelector('.online-count').innerHTML = userCount\n  }\n}\n\n// Renders a message to the page\nconst addMessage = (message) => {\n  // The user that sent this message (added by the populate-user hook)\n  const { user = {} } = message\n  const chat = document.querySelector('#chat')\n  // Escape HTML to prevent XSS a\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

This is the place to find all the resources to get started with Feathers.\n\n \n\n## The Feathers guide\n\nThe Feathers guide will walk you through all the important parts of Feathers. The [quick start](./basics/starting) gets you up and running with a Feathers API and real-time website in less than 15 minutes from scratch to give you an idea what Feathers is about.\n\nIn the next parts we will [generate an application](./basics/generator) and then walk through Feathers core concepts like services, hooks and authentication by building a complete real-time chat application with an API and a website that can register users and send and receive messages in real-time. We will also add a login with GitHub and write unit tests for our API.\n\n[Get started with the Feathers guide >](./basics/starting)\n\n## Follow up with\n\n[The API documentation >](../api/)\n\n[The cookbook for common tasks and patterns >](../cookbook/)\n\n[The Awesome FeathersJS Ecosystem >](https://github.com/feathersjs/awesome-feathersjs)\n\n[Feathers on YouTube >](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwSdIiqnDlf_lb5y1liQK2OW5daXYgKOe)\n\n## More about Feathers how and why\n\n[Read about the philosophy behind Feathers and where it came from >](https://blog.feathersjs.com/why-we-built-the-best-web-framework-you-ve-probably-never-heard-of-until-now-176afc5c6aac)\n\n[Learn about the high level design patterns behind Feathers >](https://blog.feathersjs.com/design-patterns-for-modern-web-apis-1f046635215)",

    "content": "# Migrating to v5\n\nThis guide explains the new features and changes necessary to migrate to the Feathers v5 (Dove) release. It expects applications to be using the previous Feathers v4 (Crow). See the [v4 (Crow) migration guide](https://crow.docs.feathersjs.com/guides/migrating.html) for upgrading to the previous version.\n\n## Testing the prerelease\n\nYou can run the following to upgrade all Feathers core packages:\n\n```\nnpx npm-check-updates --upgrade --filter /@feathersjs/\nnpm install\n```\n\nYou can see the migration steps necessary for the Feathers chat [here for Javascript](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat/compare/dove-pre) and [here for TypeScript](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat-ts/compare/dove-pre).\n\n## New Features\n\nThere are so many new features in this release that they got their own page! Read about the new features on the [What's New in v5](./whats-new) page.\n\n## Core SQL and MongoDB\n\nThe new [schemas and resolvers](../api/schema/index) cover most use cases previously provided by higher level ORMs like Sequelize or Mongoose in a more flexible and Feathers friendly way. This allows for a better database integration into Feathers without the overhead of a full ORM which is why the more low level [MongoDB](../api/databases/mongodb) and [Knex](../api/databases/knex) (SQL) database adapters have been moved into Feathers core for first-class SQL and MongoDB database support.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nThe new version comes with major improvements in TypeScript support from improved service typings, fully typed hook context and typed configuration. You can see the changes necessary in the Feathers chat [here](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat-ts/compare/dove-pre).\n\n### Application and hook context\n\nTo get the typed hook context and application configuration update your `declarations.ts` as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport '@feathersjs/transport-commons'\nimport { Application as ExpressFeathers } from '@feathersjs/express'\nimport { HookContext as FeathersHookContext } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\nexport interface Configuration {\n  // Put types for app.get and app.set here\n  port: number\n}\n// A mapping of service names to types. Will be extended in service files.\nexport interface ServiceTypes {}\n// The application instance type that will be used everywhere else\nexport type Application = ExpressFeathers \nexport type HookContext = FeathersHookContext \n```\n\nNow `import { HookContext } from './declarations'` can be used as the context in hooks.\n\n### Service types\n\nService types now only need the actual service class type and should no longer include the `& ServiceAddons `. E.g. for the messages service like this:\n\n```ts\n// Add this service to the service type index\ndeclare module '../../declarations' {\n  interface ServiceTypes {\n    messages: Messages\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration types\n\nA Feathers application can now also include types for the values of `app.set` and `app.get`. The configuration can also be validated and the type inferred from a [Feathers schema](../api/schema/index).\n\n### Typed params and query\n\nService `Params` no longer include a catchall property type and need to be explicitly declared for services that use extended `params`. It is also possible to pass your own query type to use with `params.query`:\n\n```ts\nimport { Params } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\nexport type MyQuery = {\n  name: string\n}\n\nexport interface MyServiceParams extends Params  {\n  user: User\n}\n```\n\nYou can revert to the previous behaviour by overriding he `Params` declaration:\n\n```ts\ndeclare module '@feathersjs/feathers/lib/declarations' {\n  interface Params {\n    [key: string]: any\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Deprecations and breaking changes\n\n### Express middleware order\n\nThe Express `rest` adapter now needs to be configured in the correct order, usually right after the `json()` middleware and before any services are registered. This is already the case in generated applications but it may have to be adjusted in a custom setup.\n\n### Core named exp\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

    "content": "# Security\n\nWe take security very seriously at Feathers. We welcome any peer review of our 100% open source code to ensure nobody's Feathers app is ever compromised or hacked. However, as a web application developer, you are responsible for the security of your application. We do our very best to make sure Feathers is as secure as possible.\n\n## Reporting security issues\n\nIn order to give the community time to respond and upgrade, we strongly urge you report all security issues to us. Send us a PM on [Discord](https://discord.gg/qa8kez8QBx) or email us at [hello@feathersjs.com](mailto:hello@feathersjs.com) with details, and we will respond ASAP. Security issues always take precedence over bug fixes and feature work; so, we'll work with you to come up with a resolution and plan and document the issue on Github in the appropriate repo.\n\nIssuing releases is typically very quick. Once an issue is resolved it is usually released immediately with the appropriate semantic version.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nHere are some things that you should be aware of when writing your app to make sure it is secure.\n\n- Make sure to set up proper [event channels](../api/channels) so that only clients that are allowed to see them can see real-time updates\n- Use hooks to check security roles to make sure users can only access data they should be permitted to. You can find useful hook utilities in [feathers-hooks-common](https://hooks-common.feathersjs.com/) and [feathers-authentication-hooks](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-authentication-hooks/).\n- Restrict the [allowed database queries](../api/databases/querying) to only the use cases your application requires by sanitizing `params.query` in a hook.\n- When you explicitly allow multiple element changes, make sure queries are secured properly to limit the items that can be changed.\n\n- Escape any HTML and JavaScript to avoid XSS attacks.\n- Escape any SQL (typically done by the SQL library) to avoid SQL injection.\n- JSON Web Tokens (JWT's) are only signed. They are **not** encrypted. Therefore, the payload can be examined on the client. This is by design. **DO NOT** put anything that should be private in the JWT `payload` unless you encrypt it first.\n- Don't use a weak `secret` for your token service. The generator creates a strong one for you automatically. No need to change it.\n\n## Technologies used\n\n- Password storage inside `@feathers/authentication-local` uses [bcrypt](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js). We don't store the salts separately since they are included in the bcrypt hashes.\n- By default, [JWT](https://jwt.io/)'s are stored in Local Storage (instead of cookies) to avoid CSRF attacks. For JWT, we use the `HS256` algorithm by default (HMAC using SHA-256 hash algorithm). If you choose to store JWT's in cookies, your app may have CSRF vulnerabilities.\n\n## XSS attacks\n\nAs with any web application **you** need to guard against XSS attacks. Since Feathers persists the JWT in localstorage in the browser, if your app falls victim to a XSS attack your JWT could be used by an attacker to make malicious requests on your behalf. This is far from ideal. Therefore you need to take extra care in preventing XSS attacks. Our stance on this particular attack vector is that if you are susceptible to XSS attacks, then a compromised JWT is the least of your worries because keystrokes could be logged and attackers can just steal passwords, credit card numbers, or anything else your users type directly.\n\nFor more information see [this issue](https://github.com/feathersjs/authentication/issues/132)",

    "content": "# What's New in v5\n\nFeathers Dove (v5) is a super-ambitious release which adds some really great tools and APIs. We don't have to mince words. This release is awesome with so many useful features.\n\nHere is an overview of each new feature, followed by links to learn more.\n\n## New TypeScript Benefits\n\nFeathers has been a TypeScript-friendly framework for years, but TypeScript support took a huge leap forward with Feathers Dove.\n\n### Complete TypeScript Rewrite\n\nWe've completely rewritten all of Feathers in TypeScript. And we're not talking about a lightweight TypeScript implementation. It's TypeScript all the way down. Everything from the official database adapters, built-in hooks, and utilities, right down to Feathers core. The newly-rebuilt [v5 CLI and generator](#rebuilt-cli) even produces a TypeScript application, by default.\n\nYou can find the shiny new TypeScript packages on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/tree/dove/packages).\n\n### Typed Client\n\nFeathers has had an isomorphic API - working equally well in browser and server - since 2016. Now with Dove, our [new CLI](#rebuilt-cli) generates **shared types for the Feathers server and client**. We even integrated the types with our new [schemas feature](#official-schemas), so you define your types once, in a single location, and use them everywhere. Everything still uses Feathers tried and proven [standard HTTP and websocket](../api/client) communication mechanism. There is no custom protocol or the slow parsing of a domain specific language (like GraphQL) necessary and since it is all plain TypeScript with type information removed at compile time, there is also no bundle size overhead.\n\nThanks to FeathersJS's clean, modular, loosely-coupled architecture, it was pleasantly simple to add this feature. This is another one of the benefits we get from building a pattern-driven framework.\n\nYou can learn more about the Feathers Client, [here](../guides/cli/client).\n\n## New Documentation\n\nThe new docs are built on [Vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/). It had become difficult to maintain all of the examples in two languages: JavaScript and TypeScript. To simplify, we now ONLY write documentation examples in TypeScript. You can still switch languages in the sidebar thanks to our custom highlighter for Vitepress, which transpiles TypeScript examples to JavaScript.\n\nYou can find the `docs` folder, [here](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/tree/dove/docs).\n\n## Framework Agnostic API\n\nIn 2016, we realized that we could decouple Feathers from the underlying HTTP transport, resulting in our first framework-agnostic, isomorphic build. As of Feathers v5, we now support three ways of using Feathers:\n\n- The Feathers client, which provides the same API in the browser, React Native and in Node.js.\n- The [KoaJS transport](../api/koa) (new in Feathers Dove)\n- The [ExpressJS transport](../api/express)\n\n### KoaJS Support\n\nThe CLI's official HTTP integration has always been built on the Express adapter. Lately, Express has been \"showing its age\", so we've made some inviting changes.\n\n- We've released the [`@feathersjs/koa`](../api/koa) adapter and utilities. Now Feathers apps can use [KoaJS](https://koajs.com/) as an API base.\n- The Feathers CLI now uses KoaJS as the default transport.\n- The Express adapter will continue to function alongside KoaJS.\n\nFeathersJS has its own, isomorphic middleware layer, based on [hooks](../api/hooks), so you likely won't need to tap into the middleware layer of any framework adapter. But, in those cases that you need framework middleware, it's available to you.\n\nRead about the KoaJS adapter, [here](../api/koa).\n\n### Lightning-Fast Routing\n\nFeathers just got a huge speed upgrade, now including its own [Radix Trie](https://iq.opengenus.org/radix-tree/) router. This means that the algorithm behind Fastify's speed is now built into Feathers, and it works no matter which framework transport you use under the hood.\n\nThe best part about the new r\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

    "title": "FAQ",
    "content": "# FAQ\n\nWe've been collecting some commonly asked questions here. We'll either be updating the guide directly, providing answers here, or both.\n\n## Why should I use Feathers?\n\nThere are many other Frameworks that let you build web applications so this is definitely a justified question. The key part for Feathers is that it takes a different approach to both, traditional MVC frameworks like Rails, Sails or NestJS and low level HTTP frameworks like Sinatra, Express or Fastify. Instead of creating routes, controllers and HTTP request and response handlers, Feathers uses services and workflows (hooks) that let you focus on your application logic independently from how it is being accessed.\n\nThis makes applications easier to understand and test and it allows Feathers to automatically provide REST APIs, websocket real-time APIs (which can often be quite a bit faster) and universal usage on the client and the server. It also makes it possible to add new communication protocols (like HTTP2 or GraphQL) without having to change anything in your application code. Feathers does all that while staying lightweight with a small API surface and codebase and flexible by letting you use it with the backend and frontend technology that best suits your needs.\n\nFor more information\n\n- [Read about the philosophy behind Feathers and where it came from](https://blog.feathersjs.com/why-we-built-the-best-web-framework-you-ve-probably-never-heard-of-until-now-176afc5c6aac)\n- [Learn about the high level design patterns behind Feathers](https://blog.feathersjs.com/design-patterns-for-modern-web-apis-1f046635215)\n\n## Is Feathers production ready?\n\nYes! Feathers had its first stable release in 2014 and is being used in production by a bunch of companies from startups to fortune 500s. For some more details see [this answer on Quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-FeathersJS-production-ready).\n\n## What Node versions does Feathers support\n\nFeathers supports all NodeJS versions from the current Active LTS upwards. See [the Node.JS working group release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) for more information.\n\n## How do I create custom methods?\n\nFeathers is built around the [REST architectural constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Architectural_constraints) reflected by its standard service methods. There are many benefits using those methods like security, predictability and sending pre-defined real-time events so you should try to structure your application with the [standard service methods](../api/services#service-methods). For example:\n\n> Send email action that does not store mail message in database.\n\nResources (services) don't have to be database records. It can be any kind of resource (like the current weather for a city or creating an email which will send it). Sending emails is usually done with either a separate email [service](../api/services):\n\n```ts\nclass EmailService {\n  async create(data: EmailData) {\n    return sendEmail(data)\n  }\n}\n\napp.use('/email', new EmailService())\n```\n\n> Place an order in e-commerce web site. Behind the scenes, there are many records will be inserted in one transaction: order_item, order_header, voucher_tracking etc.\n\nThis is what [Feathers hooks](../api/hooks) are used for. When creating a new order you also have a well defined hook chain:\n\n```ts\napp.service('orders').hooks({\n  before: {\n    create: [validateData(), checkStock(), checkVoucher()]\n  },\n  after: {\n    create: [\n      chargePayment(), // hook that calls `app.service('payment').create()`\n      sendEmail(), // hook that calls `app.service('email').create()`\n      updateStock() // Update product stock here\n    ]\n  }\n})\n```\n\nHowever, there are some use cases where you might still want to allow additional methods for a client to call (like re-sending a verification email or resetting a password on the user service) and this is what [custom service method](../api/services#custom-methods) can be used for.\n\n##\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

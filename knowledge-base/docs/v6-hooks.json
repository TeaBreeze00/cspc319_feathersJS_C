    "content": "# Hooks\n\nHooks are pluggable middleware functions that can be registered **around**, **before**, **after** or on **error**(s) of a [service method](./services). Multiple hook functions can be chained to create complex work-flows. A hook is **transport independent**, which means it does not matter if it has been called internally on the server, through HTTP(S) (REST), websockets or any other transport Feathers supports. They are also service agnostic, meaning they can be used with ​**any**​ service regardless of whether they use a database or not.\n\nHooks are commonly used to handle things like permissions, validation, logging, [authentication](./authentication/hook), [data schemas and resolvers](./schema/index), sending notifications and more. This pattern keeps your application logic flexible, composable, and easier to trace through and debug. For more information about the design patterns behind hooks see [this blog post](https://blog.feathersjs.com/api-service-composition-with-hooks-47af13aa6c01).\n\n## Quick Example\n\nThe following example logs the runtime of any service method on the `messages` service and adds `createdAt` property before saving the data to the database:\n\n```ts\nimport { feathers, type HookContext, type NextFunction } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\nconst app = feathers()\n\napp.service('messages').hooks({\n  around: {\n    all: [\n      // A hook that wraps around all other hooks and the service method\n      // logging the total runtime of a successful call\n      async (context: HookContext, next: NextFunction) => {\n        const startTime = Date.now()\n\n        await next()\n\n        console.log(`Method ${context.method} on ${context.path} took ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`)\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  before: {\n    create: [\n      async (context: HookContext) => {\n        context.data = {\n          ...context.data,\n          createdAt: Date.now()\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Hook functions\n\n### before, after and error\n\n`before`, `after` and `error` hook functions are functions that are `async` or return a promise and take the [hook context](#hook-context) as the parameter and return nothing or throw an error.\n\n```ts\nimport { HookContext } from '../declarations'\n\nexport const hookFunction = async (context: HookContext) => {\n  // Do things here\n}\n```\n\nFor more information see the [hook flow](#hook-flow) section.\n\n### around\n\n`around` hooks are a special kind of hook that allow to control the entire `before`, `after` and `error` flow in a single function. They are a Feathers specific version of the generic [@feathersjs/hooks](https://github.com/feathersjs/hooks). An `around` hook is an `async` function that accepts two arguments:\n\n- The [hook context](#hook-context)\n- An asynchronous `next` function. Somewhere in the body of the hook function, there is a call to `await next()`, which calls the `next` hooks OR the original function if all other hooks have run.\n\nIn its simplest form, an around hook looks like this:\n\n```js\nimport { HookContext, NextFunction } from '../declarations'\n\nexport const myAfoundHook = async (context: HookContext, next: NextFunction) => {\n  try {\n    // Code before `await next()` runs before the main function\n    await next()\n    // Code after `await next()` runs after the main function.\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Do things on error\n  } finally {\n    // Do things always\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAny around hook can be wrapped around another function. Calling `await next()` will either call the next hook in the chain or the service method if all other hooks have run.\n\n## Hook flow\n\nIn general, hooks are executed in the order [they are registered](#registering-hooks) with `around` hooks running first:\n\n- `around` hooks (before `await next()`)\n- `before` hooks\n- service method\n- `after` hooks\n- `around` hooks (after `await next()`)\n\nNote that since `around` hooks wrap **around** everything, the first hook to run will be the last to execute its code after `await next()`. This is reverse of the order `after` hooks e\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

    "title": "Hooks",
    "content": "# Hooks\n\nWhen we created our messages service in [the services chapter](./services), we saw that Feathers services are a great way to implement data storage and modification. Technically, we could write our entire app with services but very often we need similar functionality across multiple services. For example, we might want to check for all services if a user is allowed to access it. With just services, we would have to write this every time.\n\nThis is where Feathers hooks come in. Hooks are pluggable middleware functions that can be registered **around**, **before**, **after** or on **errors** of a service method without changing the original code.\n\nJust like services themselves, hooks are _transport independent_. They are usually also service independent, meaning they can be used with ​*any*​ service. This pattern keeps your application logic flexible, composable, and much easier to trace through and debug.\nHooks are commonly used to handle things like validation, authorization, logging, sending emails and more.\n\n## Generating a hook\n\nLet's generate a hook that logs the total runtime of a service method to the console.\n\n```sh\nnpx feathers generate hook\n```\n\nWe call our hook `log-runtime` and confirm the type with enter to make it an `around` hook.\n\n![feathers generate hook prompts](./assets/generate-hook.png)\n\nNow update `src/hooks/log-runtime.ts` as follows:\n\n```ts{2,5-10}\nimport type { HookContext, NextFunction } from '../declarations'\nimport { logger } from '../logger'\n\nexport const logRuntime = async (context: HookContext, next: NextFunction) => {\n  const startTime = Date.now()\n  // Run everything else (other hooks and service call)\n  await next()\n\n  const duration = Date.now() - startTime\n  logger.info(`Calling ${context.method} on ${context.path} took ${duration}ms`)\n}\n\n```\n\nIn this hook, we store the start time and then run all other hooks and the service method by calling `await next()`. After that we can calculate the duration in milliseconds by subtracting the start time from the current time and log the information using the application [logger](../cli/logger).\n\n## Hook functions\n\nA hook function is an `async` function that takes the [hook `context`](#hook-context) and a `next` function as the parameter. If the hook should only run on **error**, **before** or **after** the service method, it does not need a `next` function. However since we need to do both, get the start time before and the end time after, we created an `around` hook.\n\nHooks run in the order they are registered and if a hook function throws an error, all remaining hooks (and the service call if it didn't run yet) will be skipped and the error will be returned.\n\n## Hook context\n\nThe hook `context` is an object which contains information about the service method call. It has read-only and writable properties.\n\nRead-only properties are:\n\n- `context.app` - The Feathers application object. This commonly used to call other services\n- `context.service` - The service object this hook is currently running on\n- `context.path` - The path (name) of the service\n- `context.method` - The name of the service method being called\n- `context.type` - The hook type (around, before, etc)\n\nWriteable properties are:\n\n- `context.params` - The service method call `params`. For external calls, `params` usually contains:\n  - `context.params.query` - The query filter (e.g. from the REST query string) for the service call\n  - `context.params.provider` - The name of the transport the call has been made through. Usually `\"rest\"` or `\"socketio\"`. Will be `undefined` for internal calls.\n  - `context.params.user` - _If authenticated_, the data of the user making the service method call.\n- `context.id` - The `id` of the record if the service method call is a `get`, `remove`, `update` or `patch`\n- `context.data` - The `data` sent by the user in a `create`, `update` and `patch` and custom service method call\n- `context.error` - The error that was thrown (in `error` hooks)\n- `contex\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

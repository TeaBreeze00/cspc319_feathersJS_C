    "content": "# Feathers vs Firebase\n\nFirebase is a hosted platform for mobile or web applications. Just like Feathers, Firebase provides REST and real-time APIs but also includes CDN support. Feathers on the other hand leaves setting up a CDN and hosting your Feathers app up to the developer.\n\nFirebase is a closed-source, paid hosted service starting at $5/month with the next plan level starting at $49/month. Feathers is open source and can run on any hosting platform like Heroku, Modulus or on your own servers like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean and your local machine. Because Firebase can't be run locally you typically need to pay for both a shared development environment on top of any production and testing environment.\n\nFirebase has JavaScript and mobile clients and also provides framework specific bindings. Feathers currently focuses on universal usage in JavaScript environments and does not have any framework specific bindings. Mobile applications can use Feathers REST and websocket endpoints directly but at the moment there are no Feathers specific iOS and Android SDKs.\n\nFirebase currently supports offline mode whereas that is currently left up to the developer with Feathers.\n\nBoth Firebase and Feathers support email/password, token, and OAuth authentication. Firebase has not publicly disclosed the database technology they use to store your data behind their API but it seems to be an SQL variant. Feathers supports multiple databases, NoSQL and SQL alike.\n\nFor more technical details on the difference and how to potentially migrate an application you can read [how to use Feathers as an open source alternative to Firebase](https://medium.com/all-about-feathersjs/using-feathersjs-as-an-open-source-alternative-to-firebase-b5d93c200cee#.olu25brld).",

    "content": "# Feathers vs LoopBack\n\nBoth LoopBack, and Feathers are frameworks primarily meant for building APIs, and mediating between front-end clients, and backend data sources.\n\nLoopBack is maintained by StrongLoop (an IBM company); while Feathers is community maintained. Folks behind StrongLoop are also the current maintainers of the Express framework atop of which both Feathers, and LoopBack are built.\n\nWhile LoopBack is a MVC framework bringing in its own set of conventions/concepts, with route-based CRUD config for its entities, Feathers propagates a service-oriented thinking model, where in you can build lightweight services to define entities — **\"you're no longer thinking CRUD routes for an entity; but a corresponding service, which represents an entity, and the CRUD methods for it\"** — and it gets out of your way allowing you to set your own conventions.\n\nFeathers has support for multiple databases and ORMs. LoopBack only supports its inbuilt ORM (based on Juggler). It should be noted, that LoopBack v4, which is under heavy development as of this writing would open support for multiple ORMs.\n\nFeathers core is engine-agnostic; meaning it works on both client, server sides. LoopBack comes with a separate in-built client.\n\nFeathers has official libraries which can be integrated with Feathers to support multiple transport layers apart from rest; like sockets, primus, etc... This can be achieved in LoopBack via various community libraries.\n\nLoopBack comes with in-built support for generating ACLs and an in-built API explorer, which makes it easier to analyse the built APIs, via auto-generated docs. Thanks to a rich ecosystem of libraries around Feathers, this can be achieved in Feathers via third party libraries like [feathers-permissions](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-permissions), and [feathers-swagger](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-swagger), respectively.\n\nThe conveniences brought in by LoopBack come with a tradeoff of a large knowledge surface area. While LoopBack is a \"convention-over-configuration\" framework, Feathers (core) is a really small/lightweight library which gets out of your way, without enforcing any specific way of building your service-oriented APIs.",

    "content": "# Feathers vs Meteor\n\nBoth Feathers and Meteor are open source real-time JavaScript platforms that provide front end and back end support. They both allow clients to send and receive messages over websockets. Feathers lets you choose which real-time transport(s) you want to use via Socket.io or Primus, while Meteor relies on SockJS.\n\nFeathers is community supported, whereas Meteor is venture backed and has raised 31.2 million dollars to date.\n\nMeteor only has official support for MongoDB but there are some community modules of various levels of quality that support other databases. Meteor has it's own package manager and package ecosystem. They have their own template engine called Blaze which is based off of Mustache along with their own build system, but also have guides for Angular and React.\n\nFeathers has official support for many more databases and supports any front-end framework or view engine that you want by working seamlessly on the client.\n\nFeathers uses the defacto JavaScript package manager npm. As a result you can utilize the hundreds of thousands of modules published to npm. Feathers lets you decide whether you want to use Gulp, Grunt, Browserify, Webpack or any other build tool.\n\nMeteor has optimistic UI rendering and oplog tailing whereas currently Feathers leaves that up to the developer. However, we've found that being universal and utilizing websockets for both sending and receiving data alleviates the need for optimistic UI rendering and complex data diffing in most cases.\n\nBoth Meteor and Feathers provide support for email/password and OAuth authentication. Once authenticated Meteor uses sessions to maintain a logged in state, whereas Feathers keeps things stateless and uses [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) (JWT) to assess authentication state.\n\nOne big distinction is how Feathers and Meteor provide real-time across a cluster of apps. Feathers does it at the service layer or using another pub-sub service like Redis whereas Meteor relies on having access to and monitoring MongoDB operation logs as the central hub for real-time communication.",

    "content": "# Feathers vs Nest\n\nNest is a backend framework that have similar capabilities with Feathers.\n\nNest uses dependency injection system and a module based architecture, Feathers uses service based architecture with a more functional approach.\n\nNest can only be written in TypeScript whereas Feathers supports JavaScript and TypeScript.\n\nFeathers can generate client code for its server, Nest can't.\n\nNest uses RxJS for running interceptors, guards, filters or validation pipes. Feathers uses before, after and around hooks.\n\nFor more details on the difference between them you can read more here: [FeathersJS vs NestJS - Compared In 3 Key Areas](https://blog.feathersjs.com/feathersjs-vs-nestjs-compared-in-3-key-areas-427def783555)",

    "content": "# Feathers vs Sails\n\nFrom a feature standpoint, Feathers and Sails are probably the most similar of the comparisons offered here. Both provide real-time REST API's, multiple DB support, and are client-agnostic. Sails is bound to the server whereas Feathers can also be used in the browser and in React Native apps. Both frameworks use Express, with Feathers supporting the latest Express 4, while Sails supports Express 3.\n\nSails follows the MVC pattern while Feathers provides lightweight services to define your resources. Feathers uses hooks to define your business logic including validations, security policies, and serialization in reusable, chainable modules, whereas with Sails, these reside in more of a configuration file format.\n\nFeathers supports multiple ORMs while Sails only supports its own Waterline ORM.\n\nSails allows you to receive messages via websockets on the client, but, unlike Feathers, does not directly support data being sent from the client to the server over websockets. Additionally, Sails uses Socket.io for its websocket transport. Feathers also supports Socket.io but also many other socket implementations and transports.\n\nEven though the features are very similar, Feathers achieves this with much less code. Feathers also doesn't assume how you want to manage your assets or that you even have any (because you might be making a JSON API). Instead of coming bundled with Grunt, Feathers lets you use your build tool of choice.\n\nSails doesn't come with any built-in authentication support. Instead, it offers guides on how to configure Passport. By contrast, Feathers supports an official authentication plugin that is a drop-in, minimal configuration, module that provides email/password, token, and OAuth authentication much more like Meteor. Using this you can authenticate using those providers over ANY transport - HTTP, Websockets, and others.\n\nScaling a Sails app is as simple as deploying your large app multiple times behind a load balancer with some pub-sub mechanism like Redis. With Feathers you can do the same but you also have the option to mount sub-apps more like Express, spin up additional services in the same app, or split your services into small standalone microservice applications.",

The `@latest` in the command makes sure that the most recent released version of the CLI is used.\n\nFirst, choose if you want to use JavaScript or TypeScript. When presented with the project name, just hit enter, or enter a name (no spaces). Next, write a short description for your application. Confirm the next questions with the default selection by pressing Enter. If you choose a database other than __SQLite__, make sure it is reachable at the connection string. For following this guide using MongoDB, change the database selection in the dropdown below.\n\n \n\nOnce you confirm the last prompt, the final selection should look similar to this:\n\n \n\nSweet! We generated our first Feathers application in a new folder called `feathers-chat` so we need to go there.\n\n```sh\ncd feathers-chat\n```",

    "content": "By default, Feathers uses [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) for authentication. It is an access token that is issued by the Feathers server for a limited time (one day by default) and needs to be sent with every API request that requires authentication. Usually a token is issued for a specific user. Let's see if we can issue a JWT for the user that we just created.\n\nTokens can be created by sending a POST request to the `/authentication` endpoint (which is the same as calling the `create` method on the `authentication` service set up in `src/authentication`) and passing the authentication strategy you want to use along with any other relevant data. To get a JWT for an existing user through a username (email) and password login, we can use the built-in `local` authentication strategy with a request like this:\n\n```js\n// POST /authentication\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"local\",\n  \"email\": \"hello@feathersjs.com\",\n  \"password\": \"supersecret\"\n}\n```\n\nTry it:\n\n```sh\ncurl 'http://localhost:3030/authentication/' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --data-binary '{ \"strategy\": \"local\", \"email\": \"hello@feathersjs.com\", \"password\": \"supersecret\" }'\n```\n\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/6bcea48aac6c7494c2ad)\n\nThis will return something like this:\n\nThe `accessToken` can now be used for other REST requests that require authentication by sending the `Authorization: Bearer  ` HTTP header. For example to create a new message:\n\n```sh\ncurl 'http://localhost:3030/messages/' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer  ' \\\n  --data-binary '{ \"text\": \"Hello from the console\" }'\n```\n\nThat's pretty neat, but emails and passwords are boring, let's spice things up a bit.",

    "content": "OAuth is an open authentication standard supported by almost every major social platform and what gets us the log in with Facebook, Google, GitHub etc. buttons. From the Feathers perspective, the authentication flow with OAuth is pretty similar. Instead of authenticating with the `local` strategy by sending a username and password, Feathers directs the user to authorize the application with the login provider. If it is successful, Feathers authentication finds or creates the user in the `users` service with the information it got back from the provider and then issues a token for them.\n\nTo allow login with GitHub, we first have to [create a new OAuth application on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). You can put anything in the name, homepage and description fields. The callback URL **must** be set to\n\n```sh\nhttp://localhost:3030/oauth/github/callback\n```\n\n![Screenshot of the GitHub application screen](./assets/github-app.png)\n\nOnce you've clicked \"Register application\", we need to update our Feathers app configuration with the client id and secret copied from the GitHub application settings.\n\nFind the `authentication` section in `config/default.json` replace the `\n\nThis tells the OAuth strategy to redirect back to our index page after a successful login and already makes a basic login with GitHub possible. Because of the changes we made in the `users` service in the [services chapter](./services.md) we do need a small customization though. Instead of only adding `githubId` to a new user when they log in with GitHub we also include their email and the avatar image from the profile we get back. We can do this by extending the standard OAuth strategy and registering it as a GitHub specific one and overwriting the `getEntityData` method:\n\nUpdate `src/authentication.ts` as follows:\n\n```ts{1,5,14-26,33}\nimport type { Params } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\nimport { AuthenticationService, JWTStrategy } from '@feathersjs/authentication'\nimport { LocalStrategy } from '@feathersjs/authentication-local'\nimport { oauth, OAuthStrategy } from '@feathersjs/authentication-oauth'\nimport type { OAuthProfile } from '@feathersjs/authentication-oauth'\nimport type { Application } from './declarations'\n\ndeclare module './declarations' {\n  interface ServiceTypes {\n    authentication: AuthenticationService\n  }\n}\n\nclass GitHubStrategy extends OAuthStrategy {\n  async getEntityData(profile: OAuthProfile, existing: any, params: Params) {\n    const baseData = await super.getEntityData(profile, existing, params)\n\n    return {\n      ...baseData,\n      // The GitHub profile image\n      avatar: profile.avatar_url,\n      // The user email address (if available)\n      email: profile.email || profile.login\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nexport const authentication = (app: Application) => {\n  const authentication = new AuthenticationService(app)\n\n  authentication.register('jwt', new JWTStrategy())\n  authentication.register('local', new LocalStrategy())\n  authentication.register('github', new GitHubStrategy())\n\n  app.use('authentication', authentication)\n  app.configure(oauth())\n}\n```\n\nTo log in with GitHub, visit\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3030/oauth/github\n```\n\nIt will redirect to GitHub and ask to authorize our application. If everything went well, we get redirected to our homepage with the Feathers logo with the token information in the location hash. This will be used by the Feathers authentication client to authenticate our user.",

    "content": "While schemas and resolvers can be used outside of a Feathers application, you will usually encounter them in a Feathers context where they come in four kinds:\n\n- **Result** schemas and resolvers that define the data that is being returned. This is also where associated data would be fetched\n- **Data** schemas and resolvers handle the data from a `create`, `update`, `patch`, or custom service method and can be used to add/replace things like default or calculated values (e.g. the `createdAt` or `updatedAt` date) before saving it to the database\n- **Query** schemas and resolvers validate and convert the query string and can also be used for additional limitations like only allowing a user to see and modify their own data\n- **External** resolvers return a safe version of the data (by e.g. hiding a users password) that can be sent to external clients\n\nWhile it may initially look like a bit more code, schema driven development is a great way to have the data models and how data is modified in a single place.",

This is where we store a user image to show in the chat.\n- The `userDataSchema` is updated to include the `avatar` so that a new user can be created with a custom avatar\n- In the `userDataResolver`, if an `avatar` is not set, we set a default image using the [Gravatar avatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) for the email address\n- The `userQueryResolver` for the user id property allows for a user to `find` all other users but only change (`patch`, `remove`) their own data",

We will learn more about service methods and events throughout this guide, but this sums up some of the most important concepts upon which Feathers is built.",

This is where Feathers transports come in.\n\nA transport takes a service like the one we created above and turns it into a server that other clients can talk to, like a website or mobile application.\n\nIn the following example we will take our existing service and use:\n\n- `@feathersjs/koa` which uses [KoaJS](https://koajs.com/) to automatically turn our services into a REST API\n- `@feathersjs/socketio` which uses Socket.io to do the same as a WebSocket, real-time API (as we will see in a bit this is where the `created` event we saw above comes in handy).\n\nRun:\n\n```ts{2-4,42-55,58-65}\nimport { feathers } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\nimport { koa, rest, bodyParser, errorHandler, serveStatic } from '@feathersjs/koa'\nimport socketio from '@feathersjs/socketio'\n\n// This is the interface for the message data\ninterface Message {\n  id?: number\n  text: string\n}\n\n// A messages service that allows us to create new\n// and return all existing messages\nclass MessageService {\n  messages: Message[] = []\n\n  async find() {\n    // Just return all our messages\n    return this.messages\n  }\n\n  async create(data: Pick\n\nAnd in the browser visit\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3030/messages\n```\n\nto see an array with the one message we created on the server.\n\nThis is the basic setup of a Feathers API server.\n\n- The `app.use` calls probably look familiar if you have used something like Koa or Express before.\n- `app.configure` calls set up the Feathers transport to host the API.\n- `app.on('connection')` and `app.publish` are used to set up event channels, which send real-time events to the proper clients (everybody that is connected to our server in this case). You can learn [more about the channels API](../../api/channels.md) after finishing this guide.",

    "content": "Now we can look at one of the really cool features of Feathers: **It works the same in a web browser!** This means that we could take [our first app example](#our-first-app) from above and run it just the same in a website. Since we already have a server running, however, let's go a step further and create a Feathers app that talks to our `messages` service on the server using a real-time Socket.io connection.\n\nIn the same folder, add the following `index.html` page:\n\n```html\n \n \n   \n     \n     Feathers Example \n     \n     \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Welcome to Feathers \n\n       \n         \n           \n           Send \n         \n       \n       Messages \n     \n\n      \n      \n     \n      // Set up socket.io\n      const socket = io('http://localhost:3030')\n      // Initialize a Feathers app\n      const app = feathers()\n\n      // Register socket.io to talk to our server\n      app.configure(feathers.socketio(socket))\n\n      // Form submission handler that sends a new message\n      async function sendMessage(event) {\n        const messageInput = document.getElementById('message-text')\n\n        event.preventDefault()\n\n        // Create a new message with the input field value\n        await app.service('messages').create({\n          text: messageInput.value\n        })\n\n        messageInput.value = ''\n      }\n\n      // Renders a single message on the page\n      function addMessage(message) {\n        document.getElementById('main').innerHTML += ` \n           ${message.text} \n         `\n      }\n\n      const main = async () => {\n        // Find all existing messages\n        const messages = await app.service('messages').find()\n\n        // Add existing messages to the list\n        messages.forEach(addMessage)\n\n        // Add any newly created message to the list in real-time\n        app.service('messages').on('created', addMessage)\n      }\n\n      main()\n     \n   \n \n```\n\n[Try it out live >](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-m7cjfd?embed=1&file=index.html)\n\nNow in the browser if you go to\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3030\n```\n\nyou will see a simple website that allows creating new messages. It is possible to open the page in two tabs and see new messages show up on either side in real-time. You can verify that the messages got created by visiting\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3030/messages\n```\n\nYou'll see the JSON response including all current messages.",

We then hosted that service as a REST and real-time API server and used Feathers in the browser to connect to that server and create a website that can send new messages and show all existing messages in real-time.\n\nEven though we are using just NodeJS and Feathers from scratch without any additional tools, we didn't write a lot of code. In the [next chapter](./generator.md) we will look at the Feathers CLI which can create a similar Feathers application with a recommended file structure, models, database connections, authentication and more.",

We can achieve this by updating the test environment configuration in `config/test.json` with the following content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nedb\": \"../test/data\"\n}\n```\n\nThis will set up the NeDB database to use `test/data` as the base directory instead of `data/` when the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `test`. The same thing can be done with connection strings for other databases.\n\nWe also want to make sure that the database is cleaned up before every test run. To make that possible across platforms, first run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install shx --save-dev\n```\n\nNow we can update the `scripts` section of our `package.json` to the following:\n\nOn Windows the `mocha` command should look like this:\n\n```sh\nnpm run clean & SET NODE_ENV=test& mocha test/ --recursive --exit\n```\n\nThis will make sure that the `test/data` folder is removed before every test run and `NODE_ENV` is set properly.",

Since everything on top of our own hooks and services is already provided (and tested) by Feathers, we can require the [application](../../api/application.md) object and use the [service methods](../../api/services.md) directly. We \"fake\" authentication by setting `params.user` manually.\n\nBy default, the generator creates a service test file that only tests that the service exists.\n\nWe can then add similar tests that use the service. In this case we are:\n1. verifying that users can be created, the default profile image gets set and the password is encrypted\n2. ensuring that the password does not get sent to external requests\n\nWe take a similar approach for the messages service test by creating a test-specific user from the `users` service, then pass it as `params.user` when creating a new message and validates that message's content:\n\nRun `npm test` one more time, to verify that all tests are passing.",

    "content": "The Feathers application does not use a complicated dependency injection mechanism. Instead, the application is wired together using _configure functions_ to split things up into individual files. They are functions that are exported from a file and that take the Feathers [app object](../../api/application.md) and then use it to e.g. register services. Those functions are then passed to [app.configure](../../api/application.md#configurecallback).\n\nFor example, have a look at the following files:\n\n`src/services/index.ts` looks like this:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Application } from '../declarations'\nimport { user } from './users/users'\n\nexport const services = (app: Application) => {\n  app.configure(user)\n  // All services will be registered here\n}\n```\n\nIt uses another configure function exported from `src/services/users/users.ts`. The export from `src/services/index.js` is in turn used in `src/app.ts` as:\n\n```ts\n// ...\nimport { services } from './services'\n\n// ...\napp.configure(authentication)\napp.configure(services)\n// ...\n```\n\nThis is how the generator splits things up into separate files and any documentation example that uses the `app` object can be used in a configure function. You can create your own files that export a configure function and `require`/`import` and `app.configure` them.",

This makes it much easier to catch configuration errors early which can otherwise be especially difficult to debug in remote environments.\n\nThe configuration [schema definition](../../api/schema/index.md) can be found in `configuration.ts`. It is used as a [configuration schema](../../api/configuration.md#configuration-validation) and loads some default schemas for authentication and database connection configuration and adds values for `host`, `port` and the `public` hosted file folder. The types of this schema are also used for `app.get()` and `app.set()` [typings](./declarations.md). The initial configuration schema will be validated on application startup when calling [`app.listen()`](../../api/application.md#listenport) or [`app.setup()`](../../api/application.md#setupserver).",

Will be extended in service files.\n// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface\nexport interface ServiceTypes {}\n```\n\nUsually the `ServiceTypes` interface is not modified directly in this file but instead extended via `declare module` in the files where the services are registered.

An `around` hook is an `async` function that accepts two arguments:\n\n- The [hook context](../../api/hooks.md#hook-context)\n- An asynchronous `next` function. Somewhere in the body of the hook function, there is a call to `await next()`, which calls the `next` hooks OR the original function if all other hooks have run.\n\n```ts\nimport type { HookContext, NextFunction } from '../declarations'\n\nexport const myFancyHook = async (context: HookContext, next: NextFunction) => {\n  console.log(`Running hook ${name} on ${context.path}.${context.method}`)\n  await next()\n  // Do things after here\n}\n```\n\nYou can wrap the `await next()` in a `try/catch` block to also handle errors.",

To update all existing source files with the new code style run\n\n```\nnpm run prettier\n```\n\nWhen new files are generated, they will use the current Prettier configuration.

Depending on the selection, it commonly includes the [authentication hook](../../api/authentication/hook.md) and hooks that validate and resolve the schemas from the [service.schemas file](./service.schemas.md).\n\n```ts\n// Initialize hooks\napp.service(messagePath).hooks({\n  around: {\n    all: [\n      authenticate('jwt'),\n      schemaHooks.resolveExternal(messageExternalResolver),\n      schemaHooks.resolveResult(messageResolver)\n    ]\n  },\n  before: {\n    all: [schemaHooks.validateQuery(messageQueryValidator), schemaHooks.resolveQuery(messageQueryResolver)],\n    find: [],\n    get: [],\n    create: [schemaHooks.validateData(messageDataValidator), schemaHooks.resolveData(messageDataResolver)],\n    patch: [schemaHooks.validateData(messagePatchValidator), schemaHooks.resolveData(messagePatchResolver)],\n    remove: []\n  },\n  after: {\n    all: []\n  },\n  error: {\n    all: []\n  }\n})\n```\n\nNote that you can add hooks to a specific method as documented in the [hook registration API](../../api/hooks.md#registering-hooks). For example, to use the [profiling hook](./hook.md#profiling-example) only for `find` and `get` the registration can be updated like this:\n\n```ts{12-13}\nimport { profiler } from '../../hooks/profiler'\n// ...\n\n// Initialize hooks\napp.service(messagePath).hooks({\n  around: {\n    all: [\n      authenticate('jwt'),\n      schemaHooks.resolveExternal(messageExternalResolver),\n      schemaHooks.resolveResult(messageResolver)\n    ],\n    find: [profiler],\n    get: [profiler]\n  },\n  before: {\n    all: [schemaHooks.validateQuery(messageQueryValidator), schemaHooks.resolveQuery(messageQueryResolver)],\n    find: [],\n    get: [],\n    create: [schemaHooks.validateData(messageDataValidator), schemaHooks.resolveData(messageDataResolver)],\n    patch: [schemaHooks.validateData(messagePatchValidator), schemaHooks.resolveData(messagePatchResolver)],\n    remove: []\n  },\n  after: {\n    all: []\n  },\n  error: {\n    all: []\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis also applies to any hook plugins like [feathers-hooks-common](https://hooks-common.feathersjs.com/).",

We can also pass an error to render an additional error message\n- `chatTemplate` - Returns the HTML for the main chat page content (once a user is logged in)\n- `addUser(user)` is a function to add a new user to the user list on the left\n- `addMessage(message)` is a function to add a new message to the list. It will also make sure that we always scroll to the bottom of the message list as messages get added",

They will come with the newest first\n  const messages = await client.service('messages').find({\n    query: {\n      $sort: { createdAt: -1 },\n      $limit: 25\n    }\n  })\n\n  // We want to show the newest message last\n  messages.data.reverse().forEach(addMessage)\n\n  // Find all users\n  const users = await client.service('users').find()\n\n  // Add each user to the list\n  users.data.forEach(addUser)\n}\n```\n\n- `showLogin(error)` will either show the content of loginTemplate or, if the login page is already showing, add an error message. This will happen when you try to log in with invalid credentials or sign up with a user that already exists.\n- `showChat()` does several things. First, we add the static chatTemplate to the page. Then we get the latest 25 messages from the messages Feathers service (this is the same as the `/messages` endpoint of our chat API) using the Feathers query syntax. Since the list will come back with the newest message first, we need to reverse the data. Then we add each message by calling our `addMessage` function so that it looks like a chat app should — with old messages getting older as you scroll up. After that we get a list of all registered users to show them in the sidebar by calling addUser.",

We’ve built out the UI, now we have to add the functionality to actually allow people to sign up, log in and also log out.\n\n```js\n// Retrieve email/password object from the login/signup page\nconst getCredentials = () => {\n  const user = {\n    email: document.querySelector('[name=\"email\"]').value,\n    password: document.querySelector('[name=\"password\"]').value\n  }\n\n  return user\n}\n\n// Log in either using the given email/password or the token from storage\nconst login = async (credentials) => {\n  try {\n    if (!credentials) {\n      // Try to authenticate using an existing token\n      await client.reAuthenticate()\n    } else {\n      // Otherwise log in with the `local` strategy using the credentials we got\n      await client.authenticate({\n        strategy: 'local',\n        ...credentials\n      })\n    }\n\n    // If successful, show the chat page\n    showChat()\n  } catch (error) {\n    // If we got an error, show the login page\n    showLogin(error)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- `getCredentials()` gets us the values of the username (email) and password fields from the login/signup page to be used directly with Feathers authentication.\n- `login(credentials)` will either authenticate the credentials returned by getCredentials against our Feathers API using the local authentication strategy (e.g. username and password) or, if no credentials are given, try to use the JWT stored in localStorage. This will try and get the JWT from localStorage first where it is put automatically once you log in successfully so that we don’t have to log in every time we visit the chat. Only if that doesn’t work will it show the login page. Finally, if the login was successful it will show the chat page.",

    "content": "In the last step we will add event listeners for all buttons and functionality to send new messages and make the user and message list update in real-time.\n\n```js\nconst addEventListener = (selector, event, handler) => {\n  document.addEventListener(event, async (ev) => {\n    if (ev.target.closest(selector)) {\n      handler(ev)\n    }\n  })\n}\n\n// \"Signup and login\" button click handler\naddEventListener('#signup', 'click', async () => {\n  // For signup, create a new user and then log them in\n  const credentials = getCredentials()\n\n  // First create the user\n  await client.service('users').create(credentials)\n  // If successful log them in\n  await login(credentials)\n})\n\n// \"Login\" button click handler\naddEventListener('#login', 'click', async () => {\n  const user = getCredentials()\n\n  await login(user)\n})\n\n// \"Logout\" button click handler\naddEventListener('#logout', 'click', async () => {\n  await client.logout()\n\n  document.getElementById('app').innerHTML = loginTemplate()\n})\n\n// \"Send\" message form submission handler\naddEventListener('#send-message', 'submit', async (ev) => {\n  // This is the message text input field\n  const input = document.querySelector('[name=\"text\"]')\n\n  ev.preventDefault()\n\n  // Create a new message and then clear the input field\n  await client.service('messages').create({\n    text: input.value\n  })\n\n  input.value = ''\n})\n\n// Listen to created events and add the new message in real-time\nclient.service('messages').on('created', addMessage)\n\n// We will also see when new users get created in real-time\nclient.service('users').on('created', addUser)\n\n// Call login right away so we can show the chat window\n// If the user can already be authenticated\nlogin()\n```\n\n- `addEventListener` is a helper function that lets us add listeners to elements that get added or removed dynamically\n- We also added click event listeners for three buttons. `#login` will get the credentials and just log in with those. Clicking `#signup` will signup and log in at the same time. It will first create a new user on our API and then log in with that same user information. Finally, `#logout` will forget the JWT and then show the login page again.\n- The `#submit` button event listener gets the message text from the input field, creates a new message on the messages service and then clears out the field.\n- Next, we added two `created` event listeners. One for `messages` which calls the `addMessage` function to add the new message to the list and one for `users` which adds the user to the list via `addUser`. This is how Feathers does real-time and everything we need to do in order to get everything to update automatically.\n- To kick our application off, we call `login()` which as mentioned above will either show the chat application right away (if we signed in before and the token hasn’t expired) or the login page.",

This example demonstrates many of the basic principles of how you interact with a Feathers API. You can log in with the email (`hello@feathersjs.com`) and password (`supersecret`) from the user we registered in the [authentication chapter](../basics/authentication.md) or sign up and log in with a different email address.\n\nIf you run into an issue, remember you can find the complete working example at the [feathersjs/feathers-chat](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat) repository.",

The [quick start](./basics/starting.md) gets you up and running with a Feathers API and real-time website in less than 15 minutes from scratch to give you an idea what Feathers is about.\n\nIn the next parts we will [generate an application](./basics/generator.md) and then walk through Feathers core concepts like services, hooks and authentication by building a complete real-time chat application with an API and a website that can register users and send and receive messages in real-time. We will also add a login with GitHub and write unit tests for our API.\n\n[Get started with the Feathers guide >](./basics/starting.md)",

    "content": "The `whitelist` option is now split into two options: `operators` and `filters`. To migrate, you need to figure out how you're using each item from your old `whitelist`, then move them to the correct option. You can determine if each one is a filter or an operator based on where it is used in a query.\n\n- `filters` are top-level query properties.\n- `operators` are positioned under an attribute.\n\nIn the below example, `$customFilter` would be a filter, `$regex` and `$options` would be operators.\n\n```ts\nconst query = {\n  $customFilter: 'value',\n  name: {\n    $regex: /pattern/,\n    $options: 'igm'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor v5 service adapters, split the `whitelist` options into the `filters` object or the `operators` array.\n\n```ts\n// 👎`whitelist` and `allow are unsupported.\nconst oldServiceOptions = {\n  whitelist: ['$customFilter', '$ignoreCase', '$regex', '$options']\n}\n\n// 👍 Separate items into `filters` and `operators` for v5 service adapters\nconst serviceOptions = {\n  filters: {\n    // Map a custom filter to a converter function\n    $ignoreCase: (value: any) => (value === 'true' ? true : false),\n    // Enable a custom param without converting\n    $customQueryOperator: true\n  } as const,\n  operators: ['$regex', '$options']\n}\n```",

This normally (when running from the application folder) means that paths starting with `../` and `./` have to be replaced with `./` and `./config/`.\n- Configuration through environment variables should be included via the `NODE_CONFIG` JSON string or as [Custom Environment Variable support](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Environment-Variables#custom-environment-variables). To use existing environment variables add the following configuration file in `config/custom-environment-variables.json` like this:\n\n```json\n// config/custom-environment-variables.json\n{\n  \"hostname\": \"HOSTNAME\",\n  \"port\": \"PORT\",\n  \"someSetting\": {\n    \"apiKey\": \"MY_CUSTOM_API_KEY\"\n  }\n}\n```",

It was used to circumvent middleware inconsistencies from Express 3 and is no longer necessary.\n- The undocumented `app.providers` has been removed since it provided the same functionality as [`app.mixins`](../api/application.md#mixins)\n- `app.disable`, `app.disabled`, `app.enable` and `app.enabled` have been removed from basic Feathers applications. It will still be available in an Express-compatible Feathers application. `app.get()` and `app.set()` should be used instead.\n- The `req.authentication` property is no longer set on the express requests, use `req.feathers.authentication` instead.",

Send us a PM on [Discord](https://discord.gg/qa8kez8QBx) or email us at [hello@feathersjs.com](mailto:hello@feathersjs.com) with details, and we will respond ASAP. Security issues always take precedence over bug fixes and feature work; so, we'll work with you to come up with a resolution and plan and document the issue on Github in the appropriate repo.\n\nIssuing releases is typically very quick. Once an issue is resolved it is usually released immediately with the appropriate semantic version.",

You can find useful hook utilities in [feathers-hooks-common](https://hooks-common.feathersjs.com/) and [feathers-authentication-hooks](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-authentication-hooks/).\n- Restrict the [allowed database queries](../api/databases/querying.md) to only the use cases your application requires by sanitizing `params.query` in a hook.\n- When you explicitly allow multiple element changes, make sure queries are secured properly to limit the items that can be changed.\n\n- Escape any HTML and JavaScript to avoid XSS attacks.\n- Escape any SQL (typically done by the SQL library) to avoid SQL injection.\n- JSON Web Tokens (JWT's) are only signed. They are **not** encrypted. Therefore, the payload can be examined on the client. This is by design. **DO NOT** put anything that should be private in the JWT `payload` unless you encrypt it first.\n- Don't use a weak `secret` for your token service. The generator creates a strong one for you automatically. No need to change it.",

    "content": "As with any web application **you** need to guard against XSS attacks. Since Feathers persists the JWT in localstorage in the browser, if your app falls victim to a XSS attack your JWT could be used by an attacker to make malicious requests on your behalf. This is far from ideal. Therefore you need to take extra care in preventing XSS attacks. Our stance on this particular attack vector is that if you are susceptible to XSS attacks, then a compromised JWT is the least of your worries because keystrokes could be logged and attackers can just steal passwords, credit card numbers, or anything else your users type directly.\n\nFor more information see [this issue](https://github.com/feathersjs/authentication/issues/132)",

    "content": "Feathers has had an isomorphic API - working equally well in browser and server - since 2016. Now with Dove, our [new CLI](#rebuilt-cli) generates **shared types for the Feathers server and client**. We even integrated the types with our new [schemas feature](#official-schemas), so you define your types once, in a single location, and use them everywhere. Everything still uses Feathers tried and proven [standard HTTP and websocket](../api/client.md) communication mechanism. There is no custom protocol or the slow parsing of a domain specific language (like GraphQL) necessary and since it is all plain TypeScript with type information removed at compile time, there is also no bundle size overhead.\n\nThanks to FeathersJS's clean, modular, loosely-coupled architecture, it was pleasantly simple to add this feature. This is another one of the benefits we get from building a pattern-driven framework.\n\nYou can learn more about the Feathers Client, [here](../guides/cli/client.md).",

As of Feathers v5, we now support three ways of using Feathers:\n\n- The Feathers client, which provides the same API in the browser, React Native and in Node.js.\n- The [KoaJS transport](../api/koa.md) (new in Feathers Dove)\n- The [ExpressJS transport](../api/express.md)",

    "content": "The CLI's official HTTP integration has always been built on the Express adapter. Lately, Express has been \"showing its age\", so we've made some inviting changes.\n\n- We've released the [`@feathersjs/koa`](../api/koa.md) adapter and utilities. Now Feathers apps can use [KoaJS](https://koajs.com/) as an API base.\n- The Feathers CLI now uses KoaJS as the default transport.\n- The Express adapter will continue to function alongside KoaJS.\n\nFeathersJS has its own, isomorphic middleware layer, based on [hooks](../api/hooks.md), so you likely won't need to tap into the middleware layer of any framework adapter. But, in those cases that you need framework middleware, it's available to you.\n\nRead about the KoaJS adapter, [here](../api/koa.md).",

    "content": "Feathers just got a huge speed upgrade, now including its own [Radix Trie](https://iq.opengenus.org/radix-tree/) router. This means that the algorithm behind Fastify's speed is now built into Feathers, and it works no matter which framework transport you use under the hood.\n\nThe best part about the new router is that there's not another API you have to learn in order to use Feathers. It just works.\n\nFor those who want to build a custom framework transport, there's a single `.lookup` method which routes requests through Feathers.\n\nLearn about the `lookup` method, [here](/api/application#lookup).",

    "content": "Now that Feathers comes with [its own router](#lightning-fast-routing), it's possible to de-register a service to completely remove it from the application. This allows you to build cleaner, dynamically generated applications. This is a coveted feature for those who want to build, for example, a dynamic CRUD admin application that's driven by some sort of schema.\n\nLearn about service de-registration [here](../api/application.md#unusepath).",

    "content": "While Feathers [standard service methods](../api/services.md) cover 90% of the functionality you need to create and modify data, a service might also provide other custom functionality making custom Method creation one of the most-requested features for Feathers. Feathers Dove introduces an elegant solution for custom methods on top of the Feathers service interface.\n\nWhen you define your service class, you can specify additional methods on the class to create an internal-only method. To expose the method to the public API, add the method's name to the `methods` options when registering the service. Custom methods are similar to the `create` method, so you can POST to them when using HTTP-based adapters.\n\nRead more about custom methods, [here](../api/services#custom-methods).",

When your app starts in production, all of your configuration and environment variables are checked against the configuration schema. The app won't start if the schema validation fails. This keeps bugs from missing environment variables from showing up in production days to weeks after deployment.\n\nConfiguration schemas also produce TypeScript types, so the [TypeScript improvements](#new-typescript-benefits) in Feathers Dove include typed configuration lookup for `app.get()` and `app.set()`. It's really convenient.\n\nRead more about configuration schemas, [here](/api/configuration#configuration-schema)",

    "content": "Resolvers are powered by new hook utilities:\n\n- [resolveData](../api/schema/resolvers.md#data-resolvers) for incoming data.\n- [resolveResult](../api/schema/resolvers.md#result-resolvers) for results coming from databases or other services\n- [resolveDispatch](../api/schema/resolvers.md#safe-data-resolvers) for cleanly defining safe data for WebSocket / Real-time events.\n- [resolveQuery](../api/schema/resolvers.md#query-resolvers) for incoming query parameters\n\nRead about the new hooks using the links, above. These new hook utils allow you to\n\n- More cleanly manage properties on incoming records, query objects, and/or results\n- Perform advanced validation beyond what's possible with JSON Schema.\n- More efficiently write code for populating relational data (often faster than a normal ORM)\n- Save yourself a lot of boilerplate compared to writing the three features, above, manually with hooks.\n\nYou can start using resolvers right away. The new [CLI](../guides/basics/services#generating-a-service) generates them with all new services. Resolvers are one of the new tools provided in the new core package: [@feathersjs/schema](../api/schema/index.md).\n\nYou can read more about resolvers, [here](../api/schema/resolvers.md).",

One for `before`, `after`, and `error` hooks, and a new one for `around` hooks:\n\n- **Before, after, and error hooks** have been Feathers' most-used API for years.\n  - Are registered as `before`, `after`, or `error` hooks in the hook object.\n  - Continue to work fully in Feathers Dove.\n  - Are less powerful than the new \"around\" hooks, but visually simpler.\n- **Around Hooks** are new in Feathers Dove.\n  - Are registered in the `around` key of a hook object.\n  - Are capable of handling before, after, and error logic, all within a single hook function.\n  - Have a slightly different function definition than before, after, and error hooks\n  - Are more powerful yet also more visually complex (The \"after\" part of each hook runs in reverse-registered order).\n\nLet's compare the signature of the two types of hooks.",

Both hooks work together, as explained [here](/api/hooks#hook-flow).\n\nStarting with Dove, the CLI templates and new tooling features are written in `around` hooks. The around hooks simplify code in core tools because we can keep the logic for the entire hook flow (before, after, error) all in one file.\n\nHere are a couple of examples of where `around` hooks work really well:",

They are special hooks that don't run on the service level but instead directly on [app.setup](../api/application.md#setupserver) or `app.listen` and [app.teardown](../api/application.md#teardownserver). They allow you to perform some async logic while starting and stopping the Feathers server.\n\n```ts\napp.hooks({\n  setup: [connectMongoDB],\n  teardown: [closeMongoDB]\n})\n```\n\nLearn more about `setup` and `teardown` hooks, [here](../api/hooks.md#setup-and-teardown)",

    "content": "When creating the new generator, we looked at open-source generators already available. We were very impressed with [Hygen](https://hygen.io). It's absolutely impressive work, for sure, so we even wrote a custom generator to try it out. Then [@fratzinger](https://github.com/fratzinger) came up with the idea of a 100% TypeScript generator based on JavaScript template strings. We couldn't find an existing project, so we made one!\n\nThe new Feathers CLI is built on top of [Pinion](https://github.com/feathershq/pinion), our own generator with TypeScript-based templates. Instead of using some custom templating language, like Handlebars or EJS, Pinion uses Typed [Template Literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), providing some wonderful benefits:\n\n- No more mystery context. You always know the exact context of the templates and what helpers are available.\n- It just works™ with existing npm packages. There's no need to make an EJS plugin for some custom helper using an obscure API. Just import the module and use it in your template.\n- Integrates with all existing TypeScript tooling. Hover over a variable and inspect the context like you would any TS code.\n\nNow that we have what we consider the best generator on the planet, we have some exciting plans for the Feathers CLI, which we will announce in the future.\n\nYou can read more about Pinion, [here](https://github.com/feathershq/pinion)",

And they get magically compiled - on the fly - to plain JavaScript when you want it.",

    "content": "We are self-funded and community powered. In every way, Feathers has a solid foundation for a steady, stable future. How did we ever manage to build such a great framework without millions of dollars? Really, we have a wonderful, active community of contributors who share values of good API design, boilerplate elimination, and making development fun. This is rewarding for us!\n\nWe started in 2013 from a core architecture that's unique among frameworks - in **any** language. We offer the same API across multiple transports, which allows us all to build real-time, restful applications. The result is a robust, flexible framework that continues to be unique while showing its maturity. Feathers has made its way into enterprises that serve a large portion of the connected planet. With all of the new features in Feathers v5 (Dove), we're excited to build! And we're even more excited to see what you build!\n\nWe have a few more things to show off in the coming months. Stay tuned!\n\nEnjoy the release! And come chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/qa8kez8QBx) when you feel like it.",

    "title": "FAQ > Why should I use Feathers?",
    "content": "There are many other Frameworks that let you build web applications so this is definitely a justified question. The key part for Feathers is that it takes a different approach to both, traditional MVC frameworks like Rails, Sails or NestJS and low level HTTP frameworks like Sinatra, Express or Fastify. Instead of creating routes, controllers and HTTP request and response handlers, Feathers uses services and workflows (hooks) that let you focus on your application logic independently from how it is being accessed.\n\nThis makes applications easier to understand and test and it allows Feathers to automatically provide REST APIs, websocket real-time APIs (which can often be quite a bit faster) and universal usage on the client and the server. It also makes it possible to add new communication protocols (like HTTP2 or GraphQL) without having to change anything in your application code. Feathers does all that while staying lightweight with a small API surface and codebase and flexible by letting you use it with the backend and frontend technology that best suits your needs.\n\nFor more information\n\n- [Read about the philosophy behind Feathers and where it came from](https://blog.feathersjs.com/why-we-built-the-best-web-framework-you-ve-probably-never-heard-of-until-now-176afc5c6aac)\n- [Learn about the high level design patterns behind Feathers](https://blog.feathersjs.com/design-patterns-for-modern-web-apis-1f046635215)\n- [See how Feathers compares to others](https://feathersjs.com/comparison)",

    "content": "Feathers is built around the [REST architectural constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Architectural_constraints) reflected by its standard service methods. There are many benefits using those methods like security, predictability and sending pre-defined real-time events so you should try to structure your application with the [standard service methods](../api/services.md#service-methods). For example:\n\n> Send email action that does not store mail message in database.\n\nResources (services) don't have to be database records. It can be any kind of resource (like the current weather for a city or creating an email which will send it). Sending emails is usually done with either a separate email [service](../api/services.md):\n\n```ts\nclass EmailService {\n  async create(data: EmailData) {\n    return sendEmail(data)\n  }\n}\n\napp.use('/email', new EmailService())\n```\n\n> Place an order in e-commerce web site. Behind the scenes, there are many records will be inserted in one transaction: order_item, order_header, voucher_tracking etc.\n\nThis is what [Feathers hooks](../api/hooks.md) are used for. When creating a new order you also have a well defined hook chain:\n\n```ts\napp.service('orders').hooks({\n  before: {\n    create: [validateData(), checkStock(), checkVoucher()]\n  },\n  after: {\n    create: [\n      chargePayment(), // hook that calls `app.service('payment').create()`\n      sendEmail(), // hook that calls `app.service('email').create()`\n      updateStock() // Update product stock here\n    ]\n  }\n})\n```\n\nHowever, there are some use cases where you might still want to allow additional methods for a client to call (like re-sending a verification email or resetting a password on the user service) and this is what [custom service method](../api/services.md#custom-methods) can be used for.",

    "content": "Normally we find that they actually aren't needed and that it is much better to keep your routes as flat as possible. For example something like `users/:userId/posts` is - although nice to read for humans - actually not as easy to parse and process as the equivalent `/posts?userId= ` that is already [supported by Feathers database adapters](../api/databases/querying.md). Additionally, this will also work much better when using Feathers through websocket connections which do not have a concept of routes at all.\n\nHowever, nested routes for services can still be created by registering an existing service on the nested route and mapping the route parameter to a query parameter like this:\n\n```ts\napp.use('/posts', postService)\napp.use('/users', userService)\n\n// re-export the posts service on the /users/:userId/posts route\napp.use('/users/:userId/posts', app.service('posts'))\n\n// A hook that updates `data` with the route parameter\nasync function mapUserIdToData(context: HookContext) {\n  if (context.data && context.params.route.userId) {\n    context.data.userId = context.params.route.userId\n  }\n}\n\n// For the new route, map the `:userId` route parameter to the query in a hook\napp.service('users/:userId/posts').hooks({\n  before: {\n    find: [\n      async (context: HookContext) => {\n        // Map the `userId` route parameter to the query\n        context.params.query = {\n          ...context.params.query,\n          userId: context.params.route.userId\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    create: mapUserIdToData,\n    update: mapUserIdToData,\n    patch: mapUserIdToData\n  }\n})\n```\n\nNow going to `/users/123/posts` will call `postService.find({ query: { userId: 123 } })` and return all posts for that user.\n\nFor more information about URL routing and parameters, refer to [the Express chapter](../api/express.md).",

    "title": "FAQ > Why are you using JWT for sessions",
    "content": "Feathers is using [JSON web tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) for its standard authentication mechanism. Some articles like [Stop using JWT for sessions](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/13/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions/) promotes using standard cookies and HTTP sessions. While it brings up some valid points, not all of them apply to Feathers and there are other good reasons why Feathers relies on JWT:\n\n- Feathers is designed to support many different transport mechanisms, most of which do not rely on HTTP but do work well with JWT as the authentication mechanism. This is even already the case for websockets where an established connection normally is not secured by a traditional HTTP session.\n- By default the only thing that Feathers stored in the JWT payload is the user id. It is a stateful token. You can change this and make the token stateless by putting more data into the JWT payload but this is at your discretion. Currently the user is looked up on every request after the JWT is verified to not be expired or tampered with.\n- You need to make sure that you revoke JWT tokens or set a low expiration date or add custom logic to verify that a user’s account is still valid/active. Currently the default expiration is 1 day. We chose a reasonable default for most apps but depending on your application this might be too long or too short.\n\nAdditionally, it is still possible to use Feathers with existing _traditional_ Express session mechanism by using [custom Express middleware](../api/express.md). For example, `params.user` for all service calls from a traditional Express session can be passed like this:\n\n```ts\napp.use(function (req, res, next) {\n  // Set service call `param.user` from `session.user`\n  req.feathers.user = req.session.user\n})\n```",

    "content": "Feathers [database adapters](../api/databases/adapters.md) implement 90% of the functionality you may need to use Feathers with certain databases. You can also find a wide variety of community maintained database adapters [in the ecosystem](/ecosystem/?cat=Database&sort=lastPublish). However, even if your favourite database or ORM is not on the list or the adapter does not support specific functionality you are looking for, Feathers can still accommodate all your needs by [writing your own services](../api/services.md).\n\nThe why and how to write your own services is covered [in the Feathers guide](../guides/). A custom service can be generated by running `npx feathers generate service`, choosing \"A custom service\" and then editing the ` / .class.js` file to make the database calls.\n\nIf you would like to publish your own database adapter, first make sure there isn't already a [community maintained adapter](/ecosystem/?cat=Database&sort=lastPublish) for that database. If one exists, many maintainers are happy to get some help. If not, you can find a database adapter reference implementation in the [@feathersjs/memory module](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/tree/dove/packages/memory). It is always possible for community maintained adapters to graduate into an _official_ Feathers adapter, at the moment there are however no plans to add support for any new databases from the Feathers team directly.",

For example, `findOrCreate` can be implemented as a before-hook on the service's `get` method. [See this gist](https://gist.github.com/marshallswain/9fa3b1e855633af00998) for an example of how to implement this in a before-hook. It is also possible to implement [custom methods](../api/services.md#custom-methods) on the service for functionality that can't be implemented in a hook.",

    "content": "When you make a call like:\n\n```ts\nconst params = { foo: 'bar' }\n\nconst user = await client.service('users').patch(1, { admin: true }, params)\n```\n\non the client the `context.params` object will only be available in your client side hooks. It will not be provided to the server. The reason for this is because `context.params` on the server usually contains information that should be server-side only. This can be database options, whether a request is authenticated, etc. If we passed those directly from the client to the server this would be a big security risk. **Only the client side** `context.params.query` and `context.params.headers` objects are provided to the server.\n\nIf you need to pass info from the client to the server that is not part of the query you need to add it to `context.params.query` on the client side and explicitly pull it out of `context.params.query` on the server side. This can be achieved like so:\n\n```ts\n// client side\nclient.hooks({\n  before: {\n    all: [\n      async (context: HookContext) => {\n        context.params.query = {\n          ...context.params.query,\n          $client: {\n            platform: 'ios',\n            version: '1.0'\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n})\n```\n\nOn the server in `src/app`:\n\n```ts\napp.hooks({\n  before: {\n    all: [\n      async (context: HookContext) => {\n        // Pull out `$client` parameter and create a new `query` object\n        const {\n          $client: { platform, version },\n          ...query\n        } = params.query\n\n        // Update context.params with the new information\n        context.params = {\n          ...context.params,\n          platform,\n          version,\n          query\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n})\n```",

    "content": "When making a request using REST (HTTP) query _string_ values don't have any type information and will always be strings. Some database adapters that have a schema (like `feathers-mongoose` or `feathers-sequelize`) will try to convert values to the correct type but others (like `feathers-mongodb`) can't. Additionally, `null` will always be a string and always has to be converted if you want to query for `null`. This can be done in a `before` [hook](../api/hooks.md):\n\n```ts\napp.service('myservice').hooks({\n  before: {\n    find: [\n      async (context: HookContext) => {\n        const {\n          params: { query = {} }\n        } = context\n\n        if (query.phone === 'null') {\n          query.phone = null\n        }\n\n        context.params.query = query\n\n        return context\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n})\n```\n\nAlso see [this issue](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/issues/894).",

    "content": "If you are using REST and queries with larger arrays (more than 21 items to be exact) are failing, you are probably running into an issue with the [querystring](https://github.com/ljharb/qs) module which [limits the size of arrays to 21 items](https://github.com/ljharb/qs#parsing-arrays) by default. The recommended solution is to implement a custom query string parser function via `app.set('query parser', parserFunction)` with the `arrayLimit` option set to a higher value:\n\n```js\nvar qs = require('qs')\n\napp.set('query parser', function (str) {\n  return qs.parse(str, {\n    arrayLimit: 100\n  })\n})\n```\n\nFor more information see the [Express application settings](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.set) [@feathersjs/rest#88](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-rest/issues/88) and [feathers-mongoose#205](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-mongoose/issues/205).",

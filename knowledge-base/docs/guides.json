    "content": "# Quick start\n\nAlright then! Let's learn Feathers. In this quick start guide we'll create our first Feathers app, an API server and a simple website to use it. You'll see how easy it is to get started with Feathers in just a single file without additional boilerplate or tooling. If you want to jump right into creating a complete application you can go to the [Creating An App](./generator.md) chapter.\n\n<img style=\"margin: 2em;\" src=\"/img/main-character-bench.svg\" alt=\"Getting started\">\n\nFeathers works with all [currently active NodeJS releases](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule). All guides are assuming the languages features from the most current stable NodeJS release which you can get from the [NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/).\n\n\n\nAfter successful installation, the `node` and `npm` commands should be available on the terminal:\n\n```\nnode --version\n```\n\n```\nnpm --version\n```\n\n\n\nLet's create a new folder for our application:\n\n```sh\nmkdir feathers-basics\ncd feathers-basics\n```\n\nSince any Feathers application is a Node application, we can create a default [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) using `npm`:\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"ts\">\n\n```sh\nnpm init --yes\n# Install TypeScript and its NodeJS wrapper\nnpm i typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev\n# Also initialize a TS configuration file that uses modern JavaScript\nnpx tsc --init --target es2020\n```\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"js\">\n\n```sh\nnpm init --yes\n```\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n\n## Installing Feathers\n\nFeathers can be installed like any other Node module by installing the [@feathersjs/feathers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@feathersjs/feathers) package through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). The same package can also be used with module loaders like Vite, Webpack, and in React Native.\n\n```sh\nnpm install @feathersjs/feathers --save\n```\n\n\n\n## Our first app\n\nNow we can create a Feathers application with a simple `messages` service that allows us to create new messages and find all existing ones.\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"ts\">\n\nCreate a file called `app.ts` with the following content:\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"js\">\n\nCreate a file called `app.mjs` with the following content:\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n\n```ts\nimport { feathers } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\n// This is the interface for the message data\ninterface Message {\n  id?: number\n  text: string\n}\n\n// A messages service that allows us to create new\n// and return all existing messages\nclass MessageService {\n  messages: Message[] = []\n\n  async find() {\n    // Just return all our messages\n    return this.messages\n  }\n\n  async create(data: Pick<Message, 'text'>) {\n    // The new message is the data text with a unique identifier added\n    // using the messages length since it changes whenever we add one\n    const message: Message = {\n      id: this.messages.length,\n      text: data.text\n    }\n\n    // Add new message to the list\n    this.messages.push(message)\n\n    return message\n  }\n}\n\n// This tells TypeScript what services we are registering\ntype ServiceTypes = {\n  messages: MessageService\n}\n\nconst app = feathers<ServiceTypes>()\n\n// Register the message service on the Feathers application\napp.use('messages', new MessageService())\n\n// Log every time a new message has been created\napp.service('messages').on('created', (message: Message) => {\n  console.log('A new message has been created', message)\n})\n\n// A function that creates messages and then logs\n// all existing messages on the service\nconst main = async () => {\n  // Create a new message on our message service\n  await app.service('messages').create({\n    text: 'Hello Feathers'\n  })\n\n  // And another one\n  await app.service('messages').create({\n    text: 'Hello again'\n  })\n\n  // Find all existing messages\n  const messages = await app.service('messages').find()\n\n  console.log('All messages', messages)\n}\n\nmain()\n```\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"ts\">\n\nWe can run it with\n\n```sh\nnpx ts-node app.ts\n```\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n<Lan\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

    "content": "# Services\n\nServices are the heart of every Feathers application. You probably remember the service we made in the [quick start](./starting.md) to create and find messages. In this chapter we will dive more into services and create a database backed service for our chat messages.\n\n## Feathers services\n\nIn Feathers, a service is an object or instance of a class that implements certain methods. Services provide a way for Feathers to interact with different kinds of data sources in a uniform, protocol-independent way.\n\nFor example, you could use services to read and/or write data to one of the supported databases, interact with the file system, call a third-party API/service (such as MailGun for sending emails, Stripe for processing payments, or OpenWeatherMap for returning weather information), or even read and/or write to a completely different type of database.\n\nA standardized interface allows us to interact with the Database/API/Gnomes inside in a uniform manner across any transport protocol, be it REST, websockets, internally within the application, or Carrier Pigeon 🕊️\n\nOnce you write a service method, which usually does not do anything Feathers-specific, you can automatically use it as a REST endpoint or call it through a websocket. Feathers takes care of all the necessary boilerplate, so you can focus on writing the service method itself.\n\n### Service methods\n\nService methods are [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) methods that a service can implement. Feathers offers a set of general methods that a service can implement, these are:\n\n- `find` - Find all data (potentially matching a query)\n- `get` - Get a single data entry by its unique identifier\n- `create` - Create new data\n- `update` - Update an existing data entry by completely replacing it\n- `patch` - Update one or more data entries by merging with the new data\n- `remove` - Remove one or more existing data entries\n- `setup` - Called when the application is started\n- `teardown` - Called when the application is shut down\n\nBelow is an example of Feathers service interface as a class and basic registration on a Feathers application via [app.use(name, service[, options])](../../api/application.md#use-path-service):\n\n```ts\nimport { feathers } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\nimport type { Application, Id, NullableId, Params } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\nclass MyService {\n  async find(params: Params) {}\n  async get(id: Id, params: Params) {}\n  async create(data: any, params: Params) {}\n  async update(id: NullableId, data: any, params: Params) {}\n  async patch(id: NullableId, data: any, params: Params) {}\n  async remove(id: NullableId, params: Params) {}\n  async setup(path: string, app: Application) {}\n  async teardown(path: string, app: Application) {}\n}\n\nconst app = feathers<{ myservice: MyService }>()\n\napp.use('myservice', new MyService())\n```\n\nThe parameters for service methods are:\n\n- `id` - The unique identifier for the data\n- `data` - The data sent by the user (for `create`, `update`, `patch` and custom methods)\n- `params` - Additional parameters, for example the authenticated user or the query\n\nFor `setup` and `teardown` (which are only called once on application startup and shutdown) we have\n\n- `path` - The path the service is registered on\n- `app` - The [Feathers application](./../../api/application.md)\n\nUsually those methods can be used for most API functionality but it is also possible to add your own [custom service methods](../../api/services.md#custom-methods).\n\n\n\nWhen used as a REST API, incoming requests get mapped automatically to their corresponding service method like this:\n\n| Service method                              | HTTP method | Path                  |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |\n| `service.find({ query: {} })`               | GET         | /messages             |\n| `service.find({ query: { unread: true } })` | GET         | /messages?unread=true |\n| `service.ge\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

    "title": "Hooks Guide",
    "content": "# Hooks\n\nWhen we created our messages service in [the services chapter](./services.md), we saw that Feathers services are a great way to implement data storage and modification. Technically, we could write our entire app with services but very often we need similar functionality across multiple services. For example, we might want to check for all services if a user is allowed to access it. With just services, we would have to write this every time.\n\nThis is where Feathers hooks come in. Hooks are pluggable middleware functions that can be registered **around**, **before**, **after** or on **errors** of a service method without changing the original code.\n\nJust like services themselves, hooks are _transport independent_. They are usually also service independent, meaning they can be used with ​*any*​ service. This pattern keeps your application logic flexible, composable, and much easier to trace through and debug.\nHooks are commonly used to handle things like validation, authorization, logging, sending emails and more.\n\n\n\n## Generating a hook\n\nLet's generate a hook that logs the total runtime of a service method to the console.\n\n```sh\nnpx feathers generate hook\n```\n\nWe call our hook `log-runtime` and confirm the type with enter to make it an `around` hook.\n\n![feathers generate hook prompts](./assets/generate-hook.png)\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"ts\">\n\nNow update `src/hooks/log-runtime.ts` as follows:\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"js\">\n\nNow update `src/hooks/log-runtime.js` as follows:\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n\n```ts{2,5-10}\nimport type { HookContext, NextFunction } from '../declarations'\nimport { logger } from '../logger'\n\nexport const logRuntime = async (context: HookContext, next: NextFunction) => {\n  const startTime = Date.now()\n  // Run everything else (other hooks and service call)\n  await next()\n\n  const duration = Date.now() - startTime\n  logger.info(`Calling ${context.method} on ${context.path} took ${duration}ms`)\n}\n\n```\n\nIn this hook, we store the start time and then run all other hooks and the service method by calling `await next()`. After that we can calculate the duration in milliseconds by subtracting the start time from the current time and log the information using the application [logger](../cli/logger.md).\n\n## Hook functions\n\nA hook function is an `async` function that takes the [hook `context`](#hook-context) and a `next` function as the parameter. If the hook should only run on **error**, **before** or **after** the service method, it does not need a `next` function. However since we need to do both, get the start time before and the end time after, we created an `around` hook.\n\nHooks run in the order they are registered and if a hook function throws an error, all remaining hooks (and the service call if it didn't run yet) will be skipped and the error will be returned.\n\n## Hook context\n\nThe hook `context` is an object which contains information about the service method call. It has read-only and writable properties.\n\nRead-only properties are:\n\n- `context.app` - The Feathers application object. This commonly used to call other services\n- `context.service` - The service object this hook is currently running on\n- `context.path` - The path (name) of the service\n- `context.method` - The name of the service method being called\n- `context.type` - The hook type (around, before, etc)\n\nWriteable properties are:\n\n- `context.params` - The service method call `params`. For external calls, `params` usually contains:\n  - `context.params.query` - The query filter (e.g. from the REST query string) for the service call\n  - `context.params.provider` - The name of the transport the call has been made through. Usually `\"rest\"` or `\"socketio\"`. Will be `undefined` for internal calls.\n  - `context.params.user` - _If authenticated_, the data of the user making the service method call.\n- `context.id` - The `id` of the record if the service method call is a `get`, `remove`, `update` or `patch`\n- `context.data` - The `data` \n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

    "content": "# Schemas and resolvers\n\nIn Feathers, schemas and resolvers allow us to define, validate and secure our data model and types.\n\n<img style=\"margin: 2em;\" src=\"/img/professor-bird-server.svg\" alt=\"Professor bird at work\">\n\nAs we've briefly seen in the [previous chapter about hooks](./hooks.md), there were a few hooks registered already to validate schemas and resolve data. Schema validators and resolvers are used with those hooks to modify data in the hook context. Similar to how Feathers services are transport independent, schemas and resolvers are database independent. It comes in two main parts:\n\n- [TypeBox](../../api/schema/typebox.md) or [JSON schema](../../api/schema/schema.md) to define a schema. This allows us to do things like:\n  - Ensure data is valid and always in the right format\n  - Automatically get up to date TypeScript types from schema definitions\n  - Create a typed client that can be used in React, Vue etc. apps\n  - Automatically generate API documentation\n  - Validate query string filters and convert them to the correct types\n- [Resolvers](../../api/schema/resolvers.md) - Resolve schema properties based on a context (usually the [hook context](./hooks.md)). This can be used for many different things like:\n  - Populating associations\n  - Securing queries and limiting the type of requests the logged in user can perform\n  - Safely hiding sensitive data for external clients\n  - Adding read and write permissions on the property field level\n  - Hashing passwords and validating dynamic password policies\n\nIn this chapter we will look at the generated schemas and resolvers and update them with the information we need for our chat application.\n\n## Feathers schemas\n\nWhile schemas and resolvers can be used outside of a Feathers application, you will usually encounter them in a Feathers context where they come in four kinds:\n\n- **Result** schemas and resolvers that define the data that is being returned. This is also where associated data would be fetched\n- **Data** schemas and resolvers handle the data from a `create`, `update`, `patch`, or custom service method and can be used to add/replace things like default or calculated values (e.g. the `createdAt` or `updatedAt` date) before saving it to the database\n- **Query** schemas and resolvers validate and convert the query string and can also be used for additional limitations like only allowing a user to see and modify their own data\n- **External** resolvers return a safe version of the data (by e.g. hiding a users password) that can be sent to external clients\n\nWhile it may initially look like a bit more code, schema driven development is a great way to have the data models and how data is modified in a single place.\n\n## Adding a user avatar\n\nLet's extend our existing users schema to add an `avatar` property so that our users can have a profile image.\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"ts\">\n\nFirst we need to update the `src/services/users/users.schema.ts` file with the schema property for the avatar and a resolver property that sets a default avatar using the [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) based on the email address:\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"js\">\n\nFirst we need to update the `src/services/users/users.schema.js` file with the schema property for the avatar and a resolver property that sets a default avatar using the [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) based on the email address:\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n\n<DatabaseBlock global-id=\"sql\">\n\n```ts{2,17-18,34,44-54,68,82-86}\n// For more information about this file see https://dove.feathersjs.com/guides/cli/service.schemas.html\nimport crypto from 'crypto'\nimport { resolve } from '@feathersjs/schema'\nimport { Type, getValidator, querySyntax } from '@feathersjs/typebox'\nimport type { Static } from '@feathersjs/typebox'\nimport { passwordHash } from '@feathersjs/authentication-local'\n\nimport type { HookContext } from '../../declarations'\nimport { dataValidator, queryValidator } from '../../validators'\n\n// Main data model s\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

    "title": "Authentication Guide",
    "content": "# Authentication\n\nAuthentication is an important aspect of any web application that involves user accounts. It allows users to log in and prove their identity, which is critical for keeping the application secure and ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information or perform certain actions.\n\nThe Feathers CLI allows to easily add authentication to our application, including features such as creating and verifying tokens, storing and retrieving user credentials securely, and implementing OAuth-based authentication with third-party providers. The following authentication strategies are included:\n\n- __JWT__ for authenticating a request with a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/). It is an access token that is issued by the Feathers server for a limited time (one day by default). When someone logs in, Feathers issues a JWT that they need to include with every request they make to the application.\n- __Local Authentication__ allows someone to log in and create a JWT using a username (usually an email address) and password that they have already registered with our application. The CLI will also help you set up a database to store this information securely.\n- __OAuth Authentication__ allows someone to log in using their account from a third-party provider like Google, GitHub, or Twitter. The Feathers CLI can set this up too.\n\n## Generating authentication\n\nTo initialize a standard authentication setup we can run\n\n```\nnpx feathers generate authentication\n```\n\nFor the first prompt, let's select GitHub in addition to _Email + Password_ by navigating to it with the arrow down key and then pressing space. All other questions can be answered with the default by pressing enter:\n\n<DatabaseBlock global-id=\"sql\">\n\n![feathers generate authentication prompts](./assets/generate-authentication.png)\n\n</DatabaseBlock>\n\n<DatabaseBlock global-id=\"mongodb\">\n\n![feathers generate authentication prompts](./assets/generate-authentication-mongodb.png)\n\n</DatabaseBlock>\n\n\n\n## What's next?\n\nBy running this command we set up a `users` endpoint to register and store users and an `authentication` endpoint to log them in. It also generated everything necessary for a log in via GitHub. \n\nIf you're not familiar with how the authentication process works, don't worry. We'll cover that in the [Logging In](./login.md) chapter of this guide but first let's look at Feathers [core concepts of services](./services.md) that our new `users` endpoint already uses.",

    "title": "Testing Guide",
    "content": "# Writing tests\n\nThe best way to test an application is by writing tests that make sure it behaves to clients as we would expect. Feathers makes testing your application a lot easier because the services we create can be tested directly instead of having to fake HTTP requests and responses. In this chapter we will implement unit tests for our users and messages services.\n\nYou can run code linting and Mocha tests with:\n\n```sh\nnpm test\n```\n\nThis should already pass but it won't be testing any of the functionality we added in the guide so far.\n\n## Test database setup\n\nWhen testing database functionality, we want to make sure that the tests use a different database. We can achieve this by updating the test environment configuration in `config/test.json` with the following content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nedb\": \"../test/data\"\n}\n```\n\nThis will set up the NeDB database to use `test/data` as the base directory instead of `data/` when the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `test`. The same thing can be done with connection strings for other databases.\n\n\n\nWe also want to make sure that the database is cleaned up before every test run. To make that possible across platforms, first run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install shx --save-dev\n```\n\nNow we can update the `scripts` section of our `package.json` to the following:\n\n\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"ts\">\n\n```json\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"npm run compile && npm run mocha\",\n    \"dev\": \"ts-node-dev --no-notify src/\",\n    \"start\": \"npm run compile && node lib/\",\n    \"clean\": \"shx rm -rf test/data/\",\n    \"mocha\": \"npm run clean && NODE_ENV=test ts-mocha \\\"test/**/*.ts\\\" --recursive --exit\",\n    \"compile\": \"shx rm -rf lib/ && tsc\"\n  },\n```\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"js\">\n\n```json\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"npm run eslint && npm run mocha\",\n    \"eslint\": \"eslint src/. test/. --config .eslintrc.json\",\n    \"start\": \"node src/\",\n    \"clean\": \"shx rm -rf test/data/\",\n    \"mocha\": \"npm run clean && NODE_ENV=test mocha test/ --recursive --exit\"\n  }\n```\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n\n\n\nOn Windows the `mocha` command should look like this:\n\n```sh\nnpm run clean & SET NODE_ENV=test& mocha test/ --recursive --exit\n```\n\nThis will make sure that the `test/data` folder is removed before every test run and `NODE_ENV` is set properly.\n\n## Testing services\n\nTo test the `messages` and `users` services (with all hooks wired up), we could use any REST API testing tool to make requests and verify that they return correct responses.\n\nThere is a much faster, easier and complete approach. Since everything on top of our own hooks and services is already provided (and tested) by Feathers, we can require the [application](../../api/application.md) object and use the [service methods](../../api/services.md) directly. We \"fake\" authentication by setting `params.user` manually.\n\nBy default, the generator creates a service test file that only tests that the service exists.\n\n\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"ts\">\n\nE.g. like this in `test/services/users.test.ts`:\n\n```ts\nimport assert from 'assert';\nimport app from '../../src/app';\n\ndescribe('\\'users\\' service', () => {\n  it('registered the service', () => {\n    const service = app.service('users');\n\n    assert.ok(service, 'Registered the service');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"js\">\n\nE.g. like this in `test/services/users.test.js`:\n\n```js\nconst assert = require('assert');\nconst app = require('../../src/app');\n\ndescribe('\\'users\\' service', () => {\n  it('registered the service', () => {\n    const service = app.service('users');\n\n    assert.ok(service, 'Registered the service');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n\n\n\nWe can then add similar tests that use the service. In this case we are:\n1. verifying that users can be created, the default profile image gets set and the password is encrypted\n2. ensuring that the password does not get sent to external requests\n\n\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"ts\">\n\nReplace `test/services/users.test.ts` with the following:\n\n```ts\nimport assert\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

    "content": "# Creating an app\n\nIn the [quick start](./starting.md) we created a Feathers application in a single file to get a better understanding of how Feathers itself works.\n\n<img style=\"margin: 2em;\" src=\"/img/main-character-coding.svg\" alt=\"Getting started\">\n\nThe [Feathers CLI](../cli/index.md) allows us to initialize a new Feathers server with a recommended structure and generate things we commonly need like authentication, a database connection or new services. In this guide we will create a Feathers HTTP and real-time API for a chat application using the Feathers CLI. Using it, for example with [a JavaScript frontend](../frontend/javascript.md), looks like this:\n\n![The Feathers chat application](../basics/assets/feathers-chat.png)\n\nYou can find the complete example in the [feathers-chat repository](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat).\n\n## Generating the application\n\nYou can create a new Feathers application by running `npm create feathers <name>`. To create a new Feathers application called `feathers-chat` we can run:\n\n```sh\nnpm create feathers@latest feathers-chat\n```\n\nIf you never ran the command before you might be asked to confirm the package installation by pressing enter. The `@latest` in the command makes sure that the most recent released version of the CLI is used.\n\n\n\nFirst, choose if you want to use JavaScript or TypeScript. When presented with the project name, just hit enter, or enter a name (no spaces). Next, write a short description for your application. Confirm the next questions with the default selection by pressing Enter. If you choose a database other than __SQLite__, make sure it is reachable at the connection string. For following this guide using MongoDB, change the database selection in the dropdown below.\n\n<DatabaseSelect />\n<hr />\n\nOnce you confirm the last prompt, the final selection should look similar to this:\n\n<DatabaseBlock global-id=\"sql\">\n\n![feathers generate app prompts](./assets/generate-app.png)\n\n\n\n</DatabaseBlock>\n\n<DatabaseBlock global-id=\"mongodb\">\n\n![feathers generate app prompts](./assets/generate-app-mongodb.png)\n\n</DatabaseBlock>\n\nSweet! We generated our first Feathers application in a new folder called `feathers-chat` so we need to go there.\n\n```sh\ncd feathers-chat\n```\n\n\n\n## Running the server and tests\n\nThe server can be started by running\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"ts\">\n\n<DatabaseBlock global-id=\"sql\">\n\n```sh\nnpm run compile\nnpm run migrate\nnpm start\n```\n\n</DatabaseBlock>\n\n<DatabaseBlock global-id=\"mongodb\">\n\n```sh\nnpm run compile\nnpm start\n```\n\n</DatabaseBlock>\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"js\">\n\n```sh\nnpm start\n```\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n\nAfter that, you will see the Feathers logo at\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3030\n```\n\n\n\nThe app also comes with a set of basic tests which can be run with\n\n```sh\nnpm test\n```\n\nThere is also a handy development command that restarts the server automatically whenever we make a code change:\n\n```sh\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n\n\n## What's next?\n\nIn this chapter, we've created a new Feathers application. To learn more about the generated files and what you can do with the CLI, have a look at the [CLI guide](../cli/index.md) after finishing the Getting Started guide. In [the next chapter](./authentication.md) we will set up user authentication.",

    "title": "Security Best Practices",
    "content": "# Security\n\nWe take security very seriously at Feathers. We welcome any peer review of our 100% open source code to ensure nobody's Feathers app is ever compromised or hacked. However, as a web application developer, you are responsible for the security of your application. We do our very best to make sure Feathers is as secure as possible.\n\n## Reporting security issues\n\nIn order to give the community time to respond and upgrade, we strongly urge you report all security issues to us. Send us a PM on [Discord](https://discord.gg/qa8kez8QBx) or email us at [hello@feathersjs.com](mailto:hello@feathersjs.com) with details, and we will respond ASAP. Security issues always take precedence over bug fixes and feature work; so, we'll work with you to come up with a resolution and plan and document the issue on Github in the appropriate repo.\n\nIssuing releases is typically very quick. Once an issue is resolved it is usually released immediately with the appropriate semantic version.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nHere are some things that you should be aware of when writing your app to make sure it is secure.\n\n- Make sure to set up proper [event channels](../api/channels.md) so that only clients that are allowed to see them can see real-time updates\n- Use hooks to check security roles to make sure users can only access data they should be permitted to. You can find useful hook utilities in [feathers-hooks-common](https://hooks-common.feathersjs.com/) and [feathers-authentication-hooks](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-authentication-hooks/).\n- Restrict the [allowed database queries](../api/databases/querying.md) to only the use cases your application requires by sanitizing `params.query` in a hook.\n- When you explicitly allow multiple element changes, make sure queries are secured properly to limit the items that can be changed.\n\n- Escape any HTML and JavaScript to avoid XSS attacks.\n- Escape any SQL (typically done by the SQL library) to avoid SQL injection.\n- JSON Web Tokens (JWT's) are only signed. They are **not** encrypted. Therefore, the payload can be examined on the client. This is by design. **DO NOT** put anything that should be private in the JWT `payload` unless you encrypt it first.\n- Don't use a weak `secret` for your token service. The generator creates a strong one for you automatically. No need to change it.\n\n## Technologies used\n\n- Password storage inside `@feathers/authentication-local` uses [bcrypt](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js). We don't store the salts separately since they are included in the bcrypt hashes.\n- By default, [JWT](https://jwt.io/)'s are stored in Local Storage (instead of cookies) to avoid CSRF attacks. For JWT, we use the `HS256` algorithm by default (HMAC using SHA-256 hash algorithm). If you choose to store JWT's in cookies, your app may have CSRF vulnerabilities.\n\n## XSS attacks\n\nAs with any web application **you** need to guard against XSS attacks. Since Feathers persists the JWT in localstorage in the browser, if your app falls victim to a XSS attack your JWT could be used by an attacker to make malicious requests on your behalf. This is far from ideal. Therefore you need to take extra care in preventing XSS attacks. Our stance on this particular attack vector is that if you are susceptible to XSS attacks, then a compromised JWT is the least of your worries because keystrokes could be logged and attackers can just steal passwords, credit card numbers, or anything else your users type directly.\n\nFor more information see [this issue](https://github.com/feathersjs/authentication/issues/132)",

    "content": "# What's New in v5\n\nFeathers Dove (v5) is a super-ambitious release which adds some really great tools and APIs. We don't have to mince words. This release is awesome with so many useful features.\n\nHere is an overview of each new feature, followed by links to learn more.\n\n## New TypeScript Benefits\n\nFeathers has been a TypeScript-friendly framework for years, but TypeScript support took a huge leap forward with Feathers Dove.\n\n### Complete TypeScript Rewrite\n\nWe've completely rewritten all of Feathers in TypeScript. And we're not talking about a lightweight TypeScript implementation. It's TypeScript all the way down. Everything from the official database adapters, built-in hooks, and utilities, right down to Feathers core. The newly-rebuilt [v5 CLI and generator](#rebuilt-cli) even produces a TypeScript application, by default.\n\nYou can find the shiny new TypeScript packages on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/tree/dove/packages).\n\n### Typed Client\n\nFeathers has had an isomorphic API - working equally well in browser and server - since 2016. Now with Dove, our [new CLI](#rebuilt-cli) generates **shared types for the Feathers server and client**. We even integrated the types with our new [schemas feature](#official-schemas), so you define your types once, in a single location, and use them everywhere. Everything still uses Feathers tried and proven [standard HTTP and websocket](../api/client.md) communication mechanism. There is no custom protocol or the slow parsing of a domain specific language (like GraphQL) necessary and since it is all plain TypeScript with type information removed at compile time, there is also no bundle size overhead.\n\nThanks to FeathersJS's clean, modular, loosely-coupled architecture, it was pleasantly simple to add this feature. This is another one of the benefits we get from building a pattern-driven framework.\n\nYou can learn more about the Feathers Client, [here](../guides/cli/client.md).\n\n## New Documentation\n\nThe new docs are built on [Vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/). It had become difficult to maintain all of the examples in two languages: JavaScript and TypeScript. To simplify, we now ONLY write documentation examples in TypeScript. You can still switch languages in the sidebar thanks to our custom highlighter for Vitepress, which transpiles TypeScript examples to JavaScript.\n\nYou can find the `docs` folder, [here](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/tree/dove/docs).\n\n## Framework Agnostic API\n\nIn 2016, we realized that we could decouple Feathers from the underlying HTTP transport, resulting in our first framework-agnostic, isomorphic build. As of Feathers v5, we now support three ways of using Feathers:\n\n- The Feathers client, which provides the same API in the browser, React Native and in Node.js.\n- The [KoaJS transport](../api/koa.md) (new in Feathers Dove)\n- The [ExpressJS transport](../api/express.md)\n\n### KoaJS Support\n\nThe CLI's official HTTP integration has always been built on the Express adapter. Lately, Express has been \"showing its age\", so we've made some inviting changes.\n\n- We've released the [`@feathersjs/koa`](../api/koa.md) adapter and utilities. Now Feathers apps can use [KoaJS](https://koajs.com/) as an API base.\n- The Feathers CLI now uses KoaJS as the default transport.\n- The Express adapter will continue to function alongside KoaJS.\n\nFeathersJS has its own, isomorphic middleware layer, based on [hooks](../api/hooks.md), so you likely won't need to tap into the middleware layer of any framework adapter. But, in those cases that you need framework middleware, it's available to you.\n\nRead about the KoaJS adapter, [here](../api/koa.md).\n\n### Lightning-Fast Routing\n\nFeathers just got a huge speed upgrade, now including its own [Radix Trie](https://iq.opengenus.org/radix-tree/) router. This means that the algorithm behind Fastify's speed is now built into Feathers, and it works no matter which framework transport you use under the hood.\n\nThe best\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

    "content": "# Migrating to v5\n\nThis guide explains the new features and changes necessary to migrate to the Feathers v5 (Dove) release. It expects applications to be using the previous Feathers v4 (Crow). See the [v4 (Crow) migration guide](https://crow.docs.feathersjs.com/guides/migrating.html) for upgrading to the previous version.\n\n## Testing the prerelease\n\nYou can run the following to upgrade all Feathers core packages:\n\n```\nnpx npm-check-updates --upgrade --filter /@feathersjs/\nnpm install\n```\n\nYou can see the migration steps necessary for the Feathers chat [here for Javascript](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat/compare/dove-pre) and [here for TypeScript](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat-ts/compare/dove-pre).\n\n## New Features\n\nThere are so many new features in this release that they got their own page! Read about the new features on the [What's New in v5](./whats-new.md) page.\n\n## Core SQL and MongoDB\n\nThe new [schemas and resolvers](../api/schema/index.md) cover most use cases previously provided by higher level ORMs like Sequelize or Mongoose in a more flexible and Feathers friendly way. This allows for a better database integration into Feathers without the overhead of a full ORM which is why the more low level [MongoDB](../api/databases/mongodb.md) and [Knex](../api/databases/knex.md) (SQL) database adapters have been moved into Feathers core for first-class SQL and MongoDB database support.\n\n## TypeScript\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"js\">\n\nYou have selected JavaScript as the language which does not have type information.\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n\n<LanguageBlock global-id=\"ts\">\n\nThe new version comes with major improvements in TypeScript support from improved service typings, fully typed hook context and typed configuration. You can see the changes necessary in the Feathers chat [here](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat-ts/compare/dove-pre).\n\n### Application and hook context\n\nTo get the typed hook context and application configuration update your `declarations.ts` as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport '@feathersjs/transport-commons'\nimport { Application as ExpressFeathers } from '@feathersjs/express'\nimport { HookContext as FeathersHookContext } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\nexport interface Configuration {\n  // Put types for app.get and app.set here\n  port: number\n}\n// A mapping of service names to types. Will be extended in service files.\nexport interface ServiceTypes {}\n// The application instance type that will be used everywhere else\nexport type Application = ExpressFeathers<ServiceTypes, Configuration>\nexport type HookContext = FeathersHookContext<Application>\n```\n\nNow `import { HookContext } from './declarations'` can be used as the context in hooks.\n\n### Service types\n\n\n\nService types now only need the actual service class type and should no longer include the `& ServiceAddons<any>`. E.g. for the messages service like this:\n\n```ts\n// Add this service to the service type index\ndeclare module '../../declarations' {\n  interface ServiceTypes {\n    messages: Messages\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration types\n\nA Feathers application can now also include types for the values of `app.set` and `app.get`. The configuration can also be validated and the type inferred from a [Feathers schema](../api/schema/index.md).\n\n### Typed params and query\n\nService `Params` no longer include a catchall property type and need to be explicitly declared for services that use extended `params`. It is also possible to pass your own query type to use with `params.query`:\n\n```ts\nimport { Params } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\nexport type MyQuery = {\n  name: string\n}\n\nexport interface MyServiceParams extends Params<MyQuery> {\n  user: User\n}\n```\n\nYou can revert to the previous behaviour by overriding he `Params` declaration:\n\n```ts\ndeclare module '@feathersjs/feathers/lib/declarations' {\n  interface Params {\n    [key: string]: any\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</LanguageBlock>\n\n## Deprecations and breaking changes\n\n### Express middleware order\n\nThe Express `rest` adapter \n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

It is mobile friendly and will work in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. We won't be be using a transpiler like Webpack or Babel which is also why there is no TypeScript option. The final version can be found in `public/` folder of the [feathers-chat repository](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat/tree/dove/public).\n\n![The Feathers chat application](../basics/assets/feathers-chat.png)\n\n\n\n## Set up the page\n\nFirst, let's update `public/index.html` to initialize everything we need for the chat frontend:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <title>feathers-chat</title>\n    <meta name=\"description\" content=\"A Feathers chat application\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n    <link\n      href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2/dist/tailwind.min.css\"\n      rel=\"stylesheet\"\n      type=\"text/css\"\n    />\n    <link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@2.18.1/dist/full.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://dove.feathersjs.com/feathers-chat.css\" />\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\" data-theme=\"dracula\"></div>\n    <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@feathersjs/client@^5.0.0-pre.34/dist/feathers.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/socket.io/socket.io.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"module\" src=\"client.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis will load our chat CSS style, add a container div `#app` and load several libraries:\n\n- The browser version of Feathers (since we are not using a module loader like Webpack or Browserify)\n- Socket.io provided by the chat API\n- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for a collection of CSS components\n- A `client.js` for our code to live in\n\nLet’s create `public/client.js` where all the following code will live. Each of the following code samples should be added to the end of that file.\n\n## Connect to the API\n\nWe’ll start with the most important thing first, the connection to our Feathers API that connects to our server using websockets and initializes the [authentication client](../basics/authentication.md):\n\n```js\n/* global io, feathers, moment */\n// Establish a Socket.io connection\nconst socket = io()\n// Initialize our Feathers client application through Socket.io\n// with hooks and authentication.\nconst client = feathers()\n\nclient.configure(feathers.socketio(socket))\n// Use localStorage to store our login token\nclient.configure(feathers.authentication())\n```\n\n## Base HTML\n\nNext, we have to define some static and dynamic HTML that we can insert into the page when we want to show the login page (which also doubles as the signup page) and the actual chat interface:\n\n```js\n// Login screen\nconst loginTemplate = (error) => `<div class=\"login flex min-h-screen bg-neutral justify-center items-center\">\n<div class=\"card w-full max-w-sm bg-base-100 px-4 py-8 shadow-xl\">\n  <div class=\"px-4\"><i alt=\"\" class=\"h-32 w-32 block mx-auto i-logos-feathersjs invert\"></i>\n    <h1 class=\"text-5xl font-bold text-center my-5 bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-br\">\n      Feathers Chat\n    </h1>\n  </div>\n  <form class=\"card-body pt-2\">\n    ${\n      error\n        ? `<div class=\"alert alert-error justify-start\">\n      <i class=\"i-feather-alert-triangle\"></i>\n      <span class=\"flex-grow\">${error.message}</span>\n    </div>`\n        : ''\n    }\n    <div class=\"form-control\">\n      <label for=\"email\" class=\"label\"><span class=\"label-text\">Email</span></label>\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"enter email\" class=\"input input-bordered\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"form-cont\n\n[... content truncated for knowledge base ...]",

    "content": "# The Feathers CLI\n\nThe Feathers generator allows you to quickly scaffold a Feathers app with the latest standardized file structure.\n\n## Install the CLI\n\nWhen creating an application (e.g. `my-app`) with\n\n```\nnpm create feathers@latest my-app\n```\n\nthe Feathers CLI will be installed locally into your new project. This is preferred over global installation so that everybody working on your project has the same version and commands available by running `npx feathers`.\n\n## CLI Commands\n\nIn a generated application you should be able to run the `generate` command with no arguments:\n\n```bash\nnpx feathers generate\n```\n\nYou'll see the following output:\n\n```bash\nUsage: feathers generate|g [options] [command]\n\nRun a generator. Currently available:\n  app: Generate a new application\n  service: Generate a new service\n  hook: Generate a hook\n  connection: Add a new database connection\n  authentication: Add authentication to the application\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help         display help for command\n\nCommands:\n  app [options]      Generate a new application\n  service [options]  Generate a new service\n  hook [options]     Generate a hook\n  connection         Add a new database connection\n  authentication     Add authentication to the application\n  help [command]     display help for command\n```\n\n### Authentication\n\n```\nnpx feathers generate authentication\n```\n\nWill set up Feathers authentication and a users service. This is required for any other service that needs authentication.\n\n### Service\n\n```\nnpx feathers generate service\n```\n\nGenerates a service connected to a database or a custom service.\n\n### Connection\n\n```\nnpx feathers generate connection\n```\n\nSets up a new database connection. This is already done when creating a new application but you can still set up other databases.\n\n### Hook\n\n```\nnpx feathers generate hook\n```\n\nGenerates a new hook in the `hooks` folder that can then be registered in your services.\n\n### App\n\nThis is the command that runs automatically when calling\n\n```\nnpm create feathers@latest my-app\n```",

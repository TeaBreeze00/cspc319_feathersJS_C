    "content": "Quick start | feathers\n    \n    \n    • Skip to contentfeathersSearchMetaKAppearanceMenuReturn to top\n# Quick start ​\nAlright then! Let's learn Feathers. In this quick start guide we'll create our first Feathers app, an API server and a simple website to use it. You'll see how easy it is to get started with Feathers in just a single file without additional boilerplate or tooling. If you want to jump right into creating a complete application you can go to the Creating An App chapter.Feathers works with all currently active NodeJS releases. All guides are assuming the languages features from the most current stable NodeJS release which you can get from the NodeJS website.tipYou can follow this guide on your own computer in the terminal or try the steps out live without installing anything in the Feathers Quick Start on Stackblitz.After successful installation, the `node` and `npm` commands should be available on the terminal:\n```\nnode --version\n```\n\n```\nnpm --version\n```\nImportantRunning NodeJS and npm should not require admin or root privileges.Let's create a new folder for our application:sh\n```\nmkdir feathers-basics\ncd feathers-basics\n```\nSince any Feathers application is a Node application, we can create a default package.json using `npm`:sh\n```\nnpm init --yes\n# Install TypeScript and its NodeJS wrapper\nnpm i typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev\n# Also initialize a TS configuration file that uses modern JavaScript\nnpx tsc --init --target es2020\n```\nsh\n```\nnpm init --yes\n```\n\n## Installing Feathers ​\nFeathers can be installed like any other Node module by installing the @feathersjs/feathers package through npm. The same package can also be used with module loaders like Vite, Webpack, and in React Native.sh\n```\nnpm install @feathersjs/feathers --save\n```\nnoteAll Feathers core modules are in the `@feathersjs` namespace.\n## Our first app ​\nNow we can create a Feathers application with a simple `messages` service that allows us to create new messages and find all existing ones.Create a file called `app.ts` with the following content:Create a file called `app.mjs` with the following content:ts\n```\nimport { feathers } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\n// This is the interface for the message data\ninterface Message {\n  id?: number\n  text: string\n}\n\n// A messages service that allows us to create new\n// and return all existing messages\nclass MessageService {\n  messages: Message[] = []\n\n  async find() {\n    // Just return all our messages\n    return this.messages\n  }\n\n  async create(data: Pick) {\n    // The new message is the data text with a unique identifier added\n    // using the messages length since it changes whenever we add one\n    const message: Message = {\n      id: this.messages.length,\n      text: data.text\n    }\n\n    // Add new message to the list\n    this.messages.push(message)\n\n    return message\n  }\n}\n\n// This tells TypeScript what services we are registering\ntype ServiceTypes = {\n  messages: MessageService\n}\n\nconst app = feathers()\n\n// Register the message service on the Feathers application\napp.use('messages', new MessageService())\n\n// Log every time a new message has been created\napp.service('messages').on('created', (message: Message) => {\n  console.log('A new message has been created', message)\n})\n\n// A function that creates messages and then logs\n// all existing messages on the service\nconst main = async () => {\n  // Create a new message on our message service\n  await app.service('messages').create({\n    text: 'Hello Feathers'\n  })\n\n  // And another one\n  await app.service('messages').create({\n    text: 'Hello again'\n  })\n\n  // Find all existing messages\n  const messages = await app.service('messages').find()\n\n  console.log('All messages', messages)\n}\n\nmain()\n```\nWe can run it withsh\n```\nnpx ts-node app.ts\n```\nWe can run it withsh\n```\nnode app.mjs\n```\nTry it out live >We will see something like this in the terminal:sh\n```\nA new message has been created { id: 0, text: 'Hello Feathers' }\nA new message has been created { id: 1, text: 'Hello again' }\nAll messages [ { id: 0, text: 'Hello Feathers' },\n  { id: 1, text: 'Hello again' } ]\n```\nHere we implemented only `find` and `create`, but a service can also have a few other methods, specifically `get`, `update`, `patch` and `remove`. We will learn more about service methods and events throughout this guide, but this sums up some of the most important concepts upon which Feathers is built.\n## An API Server ​\nSo far we've created a Feathers application, a message service, and are listening to events. However, this is only a simple NodeJS script that prints some output and then exits. What we really want is to host it as an API server. This is where Feathers transports come in.A transport takes a service like the one we created above and turns it into a server that other clients can talk to, like a website or mobile application.In the following example we will take our existing service and use:`@feathersjs/koa` which uses KoaJS to automatically turn our ",

In this guide we will create a Feathers HTTP and real-time API for a chat application using the Feathers CLI. Using it, for example with a JavaScript frontend, looks like this:You can find the complete example in the feathers-chat repository.\n## Generating the application ​\nYou can create a new Feathers application by running `npm create feathers `. To create a new Feathers application called `feathers-chat` we can run:sh\n```\nnpm create feathers@latest feathers-chat\n```\nIf you never ran the command before you might be asked to confirm the package installation by pressing enter. The `@latest` in the command makes sure that the most recent released version of the CLI is used.NoteSince the generated application is using modern features like ES modules, the Feathers CLI requires Node 16 or newer.First, choose if you want to use JavaScript or TypeScript. When presented with the project name, just hit enter, or enter a name (no spaces). Next, write a short description for your application. Confirm the next questions with the default selection by pressing Enter. If you choose a database other than SQLite, make sure it is reachable at the connection string. For following this guide using MongoDB, change the database selection in the dropdown below.DatabaseSQLMongoDBOnce you confirm the last prompt, the final selection should look similar to this:Note`SQLite` creates an SQL database in a file so we don't need to have a database server running.Sweet! We generated our first Feathers application in a new folder called `feathers-chat` so we need to go there.sh\n```\ncd feathers-chat\n```\ntipMost generated files have a page in the CLI guide which contains more information about the file and what it does.\n## Running the server and tests ​\nThe server can be started by runningsh\n```\nnpm run compile\nnpm run migrate\nnpm start\n```\nsh\n```\nnpm run compile\nnpm start\n```\nsh\n```\nnpm start\n```\nAfter that, you will see the Feathers logo at\n```\nhttp://localhost:3030\n```\nNoteYou can exit the running process by pressing CTRL + CThe app also comes with a set of basic tests which can be run withsh\n```\nnpm test\n```\nThere is also a handy development command that restarts the server automatically whenever we make a code change:sh\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\nNoteKeep this command running throughout the rest of this guide so it will reload all our changes automatically.\n## What's next? ​\nIn this chapter, we've created a new Feathers application. To learn more about the generated files and what you can do with the CLI, have a look at the CLI guide after finishing the Getting Started guide. In the next chapter we will set up user authentication.

    "content": "Schemas and resolvers | feathers\n    \n    \n    • Skip to contentfeathersSearchMetaKAppearanceMenuReturn to top\n# Schemas and resolvers ​\nIn Feathers, schemas and resolvers allow us to define, validate and secure our data model and types.As we've briefly seen in the previous chapter about hooks, there were a few hooks registered already to validate schemas and resolve data. Schema validators and resolvers are used with those hooks to modify data in the hook context. Similar to how Feathers services are transport independent, schemas and resolvers are database independent. It comes in two main parts:TypeBox or JSON schema to define a schema. This allows us to do things like: Ensure data is valid and always in the right format\n• Automatically get up to date TypeScript types from schema definitions\n• Create a typed client that can be used in React, Vue etc. apps\n• Automatically generate API documentation\n• Validate query string filters and convert them to the correct types\n• Resolvers - Resolve schema properties based on a context (usually the hook context). This can be used for many different things like: Populating associations\n• Securing queries and limiting the type of requests the logged in user can perform\n• Safely hiding sensitive data for external clients\n• Adding read and write permissions on the property field level\n• Hashing passwords and validating dynamic password policies\n\nIn this chapter we will look at the generated schemas and resolvers and update them with the information we need for our chat application.\n\n## Feathers schemas ​\n\nWhile schemas and resolvers can be used outside of a Feathers application, you will usually encounter them in a Feathers context where they come in four kinds:\n• Result schemas and resolvers that define the data that is being returned. This is also where associated data would be fetched\n• Data schemas and resolvers handle the data from a `create`, `update`, `patch`, or custom service method and can be used to add/replace things like default or calculated values (e.g. the `createdAt` or `updatedAt` date) before saving it to the database\n• Query schemas and resolvers validate and convert the query string and can also be used for additional limitations like only allowing a user to see and modify their own data\n• External resolvers return a safe version of the data (by e.g. hiding a users password) that can be sent to external clients\n\nWhile it may initially look like a bit more code, schema driven development is a great way to have the data models and how data is modified in a single place.\n\n## Adding a user avatar ​\n\nLet's extend our existing users schema to add an `avatar` property so that our users can have a profile image.\n\nFirst we need to update the `src/services/users/users.schema.ts` file with the schema property for the avatar and a resolver property that sets a default avatar using the Gravatar based on the email address:\n\nFirst we need to update the `src/services/users/users.schema.js` file with the schema property for the avatar and a resolver property that sets a default avatar using the Gravatar based on the email address:\n\nts\n```\n// For more information about this file see https://dove.feathersjs.com/guides/cli/service.schemas.html\nimport crypto from 'crypto'\nimport { resolve } from '@feathersjs/schema'\nimport { Type, getValidator, querySyntax } from '@feathersjs/typebox'\nimport type { Static } from '@feathersjs/typebox'\nimport { passwordHash } from '@feathersjs/authentication-local'\n\nimport type { HookContext } from '../../declarations'\nimport { dataValidator, queryValidator } from '../../validators'\n\n// Main data model schema\nexport const userSchema = Type.Object(\n  {\n    id: Type.Number(),\n    email: Type.String(),\n    password: Type.Optional(Type.String()),\n    githubId: Type.Optional(Type.Number()),\n    avatar: Type.Optional(Type.String())\n  },\n  { $id: 'User', additionalProperties: false }\n)\nexport type User = Static\nexport const userValidator = getValidator(userSchema, dataValidator)\nexport const userResolver = resolve({})\n\nexport const userExternalResolver = resolve({\n  // The password should never be visible externally\n  password: async () => undefined\n})\n\n// Schema for creating new users\nexport const userDataSchema = Type.Pick(\n  userSchema,\n  ['email', 'password', 'githubId', 'avatar'],\n  {\n    $id: 'UserData',\n    additionalProperties: false\n  }\n)\nexport type UserData = Static\nexport const userDataValidator = getValidator(userDataSchema, dataValidator)\nexport const userDataResolver = resolve({\n  password: passwordHash({ strategy: 'local' }),\n  avatar: async (value, user) => {\n    // If the user passed an avatar image, use it\n    if (value !== undefined) {\n      return value\n    }\n\n    // Gravatar uses MD5 hashes from an email address to get the image\n    const hash = crypto.createHash('md5').update(user.email.toLowerCase()).digest('hex')\n    // Return the full avatar URL\n    return `https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/${hash}?s=60`\n  }\n})\n\n// Schema f",

    "content": "JavaScript web app | feathers\n    \n    \n    • Skip to contentfeathersSearchMetaKAppearanceMenuReturn to top\n# JavaScript web app ​\nAs we have seen in the quick start guide, Feathers works great in the browser and comes with client services that allow it to easily connect to a Feathers server.In this chapter we will create a real-time chat web application with signup and login using modern plain JavaScript that connects to the API server we built in the getting started guide. It is mobile friendly and will work in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. We won't be be using a transpiler like Webpack or Babel which is also why there is no TypeScript option. The final version can be found in `public/` folder of the feathers-chat repository.tipWe will not be using a frontend framework so we can focus on what Feathers is all about. Feathers is framework agnostic and can be used with any frontend framework like React, VueJS or Angular. For more information see the frameworks section.\n## Set up the page ​\nFirst, let's update `public/index.html` to initialize everything we need for the chat frontend:html\n```\n\n  \n    feathers-chat\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n```\nThis will load our chat CSS style, add a container div `#app` and load several libraries:The browser version of Feathers (since we are not using a module loader like Webpack or Browserify)\n• Socket.io provided by the chat API\n• daisyUI for a collection of CSS components\n• A `client.js` for our code to live in\n\nLet’s create `public/client.js` where all the following code will live. Each of the following code samples should be added to the end of that file.\n\n## Connect to the API ​\n\nWe’ll start with the most important thing first, the connection to our Feathers API that connects to our server using websockets and initializes the authentication client:\n\njs\n```\n/* global io, feathers, moment */\n// Establish a Socket.io connection\nconst socket = io()\n// Initialize our Feathers client application through Socket.io\n// with hooks and authentication.\nconst client = feathers()\n\nclient.configure(feathers.socketio(socket))\n// Use localStorage to store our login token\nclient.configure(feathers.authentication())\n```\n\n## Base HTML ​\n\nNext, we have to define some static and dynamic HTML that we can insert into the page when we want to show the login page (which also doubles as the signup page) and the actual chat interface:\n\njs\n```\n// Login screen\nconst loginTemplate = (error) => `\n\n  \n\n    \n# Feathers Chat\n\n  \n\n  \n    ${\n      error\n        ? `\n\n      \n      ${error.message}\n    \n`\n        : ''\n    }\n    \n\n      Email\n      \n    \n\n    \n\n      Password\n      \n    \n\n    \nLogin\n\n    \nSignup\n\n    \nLogin with GitHub\n\n  \n\n`\n\n// Main chat view\nconst chatTemplate =\n  () => `\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \n\n        \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n\n        \nFeathers Chat\n\n        \n          0 User(s)\n        \n      \n\n      \n\n        \n\n        \n      \n\n      \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \n        \n        Send\n      \n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n      • Users\n\n    \n  \n\n`\n\n// Helper to safely escape HTML\nconst escapeHTML = (str) => str.replace(/&/g, '&amp').replace(//g, '&gt')\n\nconst formatDate = (timestamp) =>\n  new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {\n    timeStyle: 'short',\n    dateStyle: 'medium'\n  }).format(new Date(timestamp))\n\n// Add a new user to the list\nconst addUser = (user) => {\n  const userList = document.querySelector('.user-list')\n\n  if (userList) {\n    // Add the user to the list\n    userList.innerHTML += `• ${user.email}\n`\n\n    // Update the number of users\n    const userCount = document.querySelectorAll('.user-list li.user').length\n\n    document.querySelector('.online-count').innerHTML = userCount\n  }\n}\n\n// Renders a message to the page\nconst addMessage = (message) => {\n  // The user that sent this message (added by the populate-user hook)\n  const { user = {} } = message\n  const chat = document.querySelector('#chat')\n  // Escape HTML to prevent XSS attacks\n  const text = escapeHTML(message.text)\n\n  if (chat) {\n    chat.innerHTML += `\n\n      \n\n        \n\n          \n        \n\n      \n\n      \n\n        ${user.email}\n        ${formatDate(message.createdAt)}\n      \n\n      \n${text}\n\n    \n`\n\n    // Always scroll to the bottom of our message list\n    chat.scrollTop = chat.scrollHeight - chat.clientHeight\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will add the following variables and functions:\n• `loginTemplate` - A function that returns static HTML for the login/signup page. We can also pass an error to render an additional error message\n• `chatTemplate` - Returns the HTML for the main chat page content (once a user is logged in)\n• `addUser(user)` is a function to add a new user to the user list on the left\n• `addMessage(message)` is a function to add a new message to the list. It will also make sure that we always scroll to the bottom of the message list as messages get added\n\n## Displaying pages ​\n\nNext, we'll add two functions to display the login and chat page, where we'll also add a l",

To keep the test self-contained it will then remove the test user on the servertipNote that you can use `client` for client side interactions and the server side application `app` object for server side calls in the same file. For example, if the user required an email verification but you don't want to test sending out emails you can call something like `app.service('users').patch(user.id, { isVerified: true })` to enable the new user on the server.

By default it just checks if the service has been registered.\n## Testing the service ​\nServices can be tested by using the application object through Feathers standard APIs:ts\n```\n// For more information about this file see https://dove.feathersjs.com/guides/cli/service.test.html\nimport assert from 'assert'\nimport { app } from '../../../src/app'\n\ndescribe('users service', () => {\n  it('registered the service', () => {\n    const service = app.service('users')\n\n    assert.ok(service, 'Registered the service')\n  })\n\n  it('finds all users', async () => {\n    const users = await app.service('users').find({\n      paginate: false\n    })\n\n    assert.ok(Array.isArray(users))\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Authenticated tests ​\nTo test service internals that require a logged in user, it is not necessary to go through the full authentication flow. Instead a test user can be created and then passed as `params.user` just like it would when authenticated:ts\n```\n// For more information about this file see https://dove.feathersjs.com/guides/cli/service.test.html\nimport assert from 'assert'\nimport { app } from '../../../src/app'\n\ndescribe('messages service', () => {\n  it('registered the service', () => {\n    const service = app.service('messages')\n\n    assert.ok(service, 'Registered the service')\n  })\n\n  it('can create a new message for a user', async () => {\n    const user = await app.service('users').create({\n      email: '[email protected]',\n      password: 'supersecret'\n    })\n\n    const message = await app.service('messages').create(\n      {\n        text: 'Hello world'\n      },\n      { user }\n    )\n\n    assert.strictEqual(message.userId, user.id)\n\n    await app.service('messages').remove(message.id)\n    await app.service('users').remove(user.id)\n  })\n})\n```\ntipIf you want to test the full authentication and external access flow the client.test can be used.

    "content": "What's New in v5 | feathers\n    \n    \n    • Skip to contentfeathersSearchMetaKAppearanceMenuReturn to top\n# What's New in v5 ​\nFeathers Dove (v5) is a super-ambitious release which adds some really great tools and APIs. We don't have to mince words. This release is awesome with so many useful features.Here is an overview of each new feature, followed by links to learn more.\n## New TypeScript Benefits ​\nFeathers has been a TypeScript-friendly framework for years, but TypeScript support took a huge leap forward with Feathers Dove.\n### Complete TypeScript Rewrite ​\nWe've completely rewritten all of Feathers in TypeScript. And we're not talking about a lightweight TypeScript implementation. It's TypeScript all the way down. Everything from the official database adapters, built-in hooks, and utilities, right down to Feathers core. The newly-rebuilt v5 CLI and generator even produces a TypeScript application, by default.You can find the shiny new TypeScript packages on GitHub, here.\n### Typed Client ​\nFeathers has had an isomorphic API - working equally well in browser and server - since 2016. Now with Dove, our new CLI generates shared types for the Feathers server and client. We even integrated the types with our new schemas feature, so you define your types once, in a single location, and use them everywhere. Everything still uses Feathers tried and proven standard HTTP and websocket communication mechanism. There is no custom protocol or the slow parsing of a domain specific language (like GraphQL) necessary and since it is all plain TypeScript with type information removed at compile time, there is also no bundle size overhead.Thanks to FeathersJS's clean, modular, loosely-coupled architecture, it was pleasantly simple to add this feature. This is another one of the benefits we get from building a pattern-driven framework.You can learn more about the Feathers Client, here.\n## New Documentation ​\nThe new docs are built on Vitepress. It had become difficult to maintain all of the examples in two languages: JavaScript and TypeScript. To simplify, we now ONLY write documentation examples in TypeScript. You can still switch languages in the sidebar thanks to our custom highlighter for Vitepress, which transpiles TypeScript examples to JavaScript.You can find the `docs` folder, here.\n## Framework Agnostic API ​\nIn 2016, we realized that we could decouple Feathers from the underlying HTTP transport, resulting in our first framework-agnostic, isomorphic build. As of Feathers v5, we now support three ways of using Feathers:The Feathers client, which provides the same API in the browser, React Native and in Node.js.\n• The KoaJS transport (new in Feathers Dove)\n• The ExpressJS transport\n\n### KoaJS Support ​\n\nThe CLI's official HTTP integration has always been built on the Express adapter. Lately, Express has been \"showing its age\", so we've made some inviting changes.\n• We've released the `@feathersjs/koa` adapter and utilities. Now Feathers apps can use KoaJS as an API base.\n• The Feathers CLI now uses KoaJS as the default transport.\n• The Express adapter will continue to function alongside KoaJS.\n\nFeathersJS has its own, isomorphic middleware layer, based on hooks, so you likely won't need to tap into the middleware layer of any framework adapter. But, in those cases that you need framework middleware, it's available to you.\n\nRead about the KoaJS adapter, here.\n\n### Lightning-Fast Routing ​\n\nFeathers just got a huge speed upgrade, now including its own Radix Trie router. This means that the algorithm behind Fastify's speed is now built into Feathers, and it works no matter which framework transport you use under the hood.\n\nThe best part about the new router is that there's not another API you have to learn in order to use Feathers. It just works.\n\nFor those who want to build a custom framework transport, there's a single `.lookup` method which routes requests through Feathers.\n\nLearn about the `lookup` method, here.\n\n### Service De-Registration ​\n\nNow that Feathers comes with its own router, it's possible to de-register a service to completely remove it from the application. This allows you to build cleaner, dynamically generated applications. This is a coveted feature for those who want to build, for example, a dynamic CRUD admin application that's driven by some sort of schema.\n\nLearn about service de-registration here.\n\n## Custom Methods ​\n\nWhile Feathers standard service methods cover 90% of the functionality you need to create and modify data, a service might also provide other custom functionality making custom Method creation one of the most-requested features for Feathers. Feathers Dove introduces an elegant solution for custom methods on top of the Feathers service interface.\n\nWhen you define your service class, you can specify additional methods on the class to create an internal-only method. To expose the method to the public API, add the method's name to the `methods` options when registering the service.",

It expects applications to be using the previous Feathers v4 (Crow). See the v4 (Crow) migration guide for upgrading to the previous version.\n## Testing the prerelease ​\nYou can run the following to upgrade all Feathers core packages:\n```\nnpx npm-check-updates --upgrade --filter /@feathersjs/\nnpm install\n```\nYou can see the migration steps necessary for the Feathers chat here for Javascript and here for TypeScript.\n## New Features ​\nThere are so many new features in this release that they got their own page! Read about the new features on the What's New in v5 page.\n## Core SQL and MongoDB ​\nThe new schemas and resolvers cover most use cases previously provided by higher level ORMs like Sequelize or Mongoose in a more flexible and Feathers friendly way. This allows for a better database integration into Feathers without the overhead of a full ORM which is why the more low level MongoDB and Knex (SQL) database adapters have been moved into Feathers core for first-class SQL and MongoDB database support.\n## TypeScript ​\nYou have selected JavaScript as the language which does not have type information.The new version comes with major improvements in TypeScript support from improved service typings, fully typed hook context and typed configuration. You can see the changes necessary in the Feathers chat here.\n### Application and hook context ​\nTo get the typed hook context and application configuration update your `declarations.ts` as follows:ts\n```\nimport '@feathersjs/transport-commons'\nimport { Application as ExpressFeathers } from '@feathersjs/express'\nimport { HookContext as FeathersHookContext } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\nexport interface Configuration {\n  // Put types for app.get and app.set here\n  port: number\n}\n// A mapping of service names to types. Will be extended in service files.\nexport interface ServiceTypes {}\n// The application instance type that will be used everywhere else\nexport type Application = ExpressFeathers\nexport type HookContext = FeathersHookContext\n```\nNow `import { HookContext } from './declarations'` can be used as the context in hooks.\n### Service types ​\nService types now only need the actual service class type and should no longer include the `& ServiceAddons`. E.g. for the messages service like this:ts\n```\n// Add this service to the service type index\ndeclare module '../../declarations' {\n  interface ServiceTypes {\n    messages: Messages\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration types ​\nA Feathers application can now also include types for the values of `app.set` and `app.get`. The configuration can also be validated and the type inferred from a Feathers schema.\n### Typed params and query ​\nService `Params` no longer include a catchall property type and need to be explicitly declared for services that use extended `params`. It is also possible to pass your own query type to use with `params.query`:ts\n```\nimport { Params } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n\nexport type MyQuery = {\n  name: string\n}\n\nexport interface MyServiceParams extends Params {\n  user: User\n}\n```\nYou can revert to the previous behaviour by overriding he `Params` declaration:ts\n```\ndeclare module '@feathersjs/feathers/lib/declarations' {\n  interface Params {\n    [key: string]: any\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Deprecations and breaking changes ​\n\n### Express middleware order ​\nThe Express `rest` adapter now needs to be configured in the correct order, usually right after the `json()` middleware and before any services are registered. This is already the case in generated applications but it may have to be adjusted in a custom setup.\n### Core named export ​\nThe import of `feathers` has changed fromts\n```\nconst feathers = require('@feathersjs/feathers')\n\nimport feathers from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n```\nTots\n```\nconst { feathers } = require('@feathersjs/feathers')\n\nimport { feathers } from '@feathersjs/feathers'\n```\nThe Express exports for TypeScript have changed fromts\n```\nimport express from '@feathersjs/express'\n\napp.use(express.json())\napp.use(express.urlencoded())\napp.use(express.notFound())\napp.use(express.errorHandler())\n```\nTots\n```\nimport express, { json, urlencoded, notFound, errorHandler } from '@feathersjs/express'\n\napp.use(json())\napp.use(urlencoded())\napp.use(notFound())\napp.use(errorHandler())\n```\n\n### Custom Filters & Operators ​\npendingWe are exploring the best migration strategy to replace \"whitelisting\" options with a solution based on Feathers schema. We'll update this guide once the solution is in place.The `whitelist` option is now split into two options: `operators` and `filters`. To migrate, you need to figure out how you're using each item from your old `whitelist`, then move them to the correct option. You can determine if each one is a filter or an operator based on where it is used in a query.`f",

In this chapter we will create a real-time chat frontend with signup and login using modern plain JavaScript. It will only work in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge since we won't be using a transpiler like Webpack or Babel (which is also why there won't be a TypeScript option). The final version can be found here (opens new window) . Note: We will not be using a frontend framework so we can focus on what Feathers is all about. Feathers is framework agnostic and can be used with any frontend framework like React, VueJS or Angular. For more information see the frameworks section . # Set up the page First, let's update public/index.html to initialize everything we need for the chat frontend: < html lang = \" en \" > < head > < meta http-equiv = \" content-type \" content = \" text/html; charset=utf-8 \" > < meta name = \" viewport \" content = \" width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0 \" /> < title > FeathersJS chat </ title > < link rel = \" shortcut icon \" href = \" favicon.ico \" > < link rel = \" stylesheet \" href = \" //unpkg.com/feathers-chat@4.0.0/public/base.css \" > < link rel = \" stylesheet \" href = \" //unpkg.com/feathers-chat@4.0.0/public/chat.css \" > </ head > < body > < div id = \" app \" class = \" flex flex-column \" > </ div > < script src = \" //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.12.0/moment.js \" > </ script > < script src = \" //unpkg.com/@feathersjs/client@^4.3.0/dist/feathers.js \" > </ script > < script src = \" /socket.io/socket.io.js \" > </ script > < script src = \" client.js \" > </ script > </ body > </ html >",

This means that the current release (Crow) will be Feathers v4 and using this release means all @feathersjs/ module dependencies show a version of 4.x.x ( 4.0.0-pre.x for prereleases). For historical reasons the first official version will be 4.3.0 . The database adapters will continue to be individually versioned, since they can be used with most Feathers versions from v2 and up. # Auto upgrade The @feathersjs/cli comes with a command to automatically upgrade applications generated through @feathersjs/cli (v3.x) with most of the changes necessary for v4.
